<h3>
INTRODUCTION
</h3>

<p>
On the 11th day of December 1899, amid the rattle of
rifles, the fierce booming of cannon, and the sharp bang
of exploding shells, a British force of Scottish Highlanders
found themselves suddenly confronted in the darkness of
an early African morning by an unseen enemy.  All
night they had been on the march, tramping the bare
rocky veldt north of the Modder river, to attack, and if
possible capture, the fortified and strongly entrenched
position held by the Boer army of General Cronje among
the rocks and cliffs of Magersfontein.  This was full of
difficulty and danger.  But the relief of the beleaguered
garrison of Kimberley was urgent, and if the work were to
be done, it demanded the best the British army could
achieve.  Steadily and determinedly stepped out the men
of the Highland Brigade, commanded by him they had long
had reason to trust.  As lieutenant, as captain, as colonel,
they had followed him in many a well-fought battle, and
now with Major-General Wauchope leading them in the
darkness, no doubt or fear entered their breast.
</p>

<p>
But suddenly there was a flash of light from the rocks
above, followed immediately by a long belching flame of
fire from a thousand rifles in front.  They had unexpectedly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P10"></a>10}</span>
stumbled on the enemy.  There was no time for reorganisation,
and in the midst of an entanglement of trenches and
barbed wire fencing, and exposed the while to a withering
fire against which nothing human could stand, the
Highland Brigade was mown down.  Here it was, but well
in front of his men, endeavouring to the last to cheer on
his followers, one of the most gallant and daring of
modern British generals fought and fell, a martyr for his
Queen and country.
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope's tragic end was no unfitting conclusion
to a life of devoted, arduous service.  He died as
he had lived, ever in the midst of strife, an earnest, brave,
and self-denying man, thinking more of others than
himself; graced with the dignity that comes from inborn
gentleness of spirit, and ever in his conduct exemplifying
the faith he professed.  No wonder that when such a man
fell, there was a wail of lamentation, not merely around
his own home in Edinburgh where he was best known and
loved, but throughout the whole British Empire.
</p>

<p>
The story of his life is one of incident and hairbreadth
escapes, and it deserves to rank high in the military
annals of our country; for among those who have helped
to raise Great Britain to the honourable position she holds
among the nations of the world, as the vindicator of
freedom, as the protector of the weak against the strong,
as the pioneer of commerce, and the disseminator of
Christianity, there are few who have laboured more
zealously or fought more bravely than he whose career
we shall in the following pages attempt to sketch.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P11"></a>11}</span>
</p>

<p>
In biography there is perhaps nothing more alluring
than to trace out traits in remote kindred, and to watch
them coming forth with new accompaniments in later
generations, to work out, as it were, the full story of the
race, and probably to mark a climax in some chosen
individual.  Though we have not space to follow this out
in the present case, the distinguishing characteristics of
General Wauchope's ancestors may easily be discerned
throughout his career; to them he doubtless owed that
simple manliness which looked upon every man&mdash;whatever
his station&mdash;as a brother; that unswerving courage in
time of danger, that unflinching devotion to duty, that
cheerfulness of disposition, which made him a general
favourite; all sobered by a sense of the unseen and eternal
which entered into the very heart of his life.
</p>

<p>
The author's efforts to gather the scattered material of
so chequered a career have been met on all hands by so
willing a response from those who could in any way claim
the General's acquaintance, that his task has been a
pleasant and a comparatively easy one.  For interesting
details and incidents coming under their personal
observation, his best thanks are due to Admiral Lord Charles
W. D. Beresford, C.B.; General Sir Robert Biddulph,
G.C.M.G., G.C.B., lately Governor of Gibraltar; Sir John
C. M'Leod, G.C.B.; Colonel R. K. Bayly, C.B.; Colonel
Brickenden; Colonel Gordon J. C. Money; Major A. G. Duff;
Captain Christie, and other of his brother officers
who shared with him the dangers and toil of naval and
military service, in various parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P12"></a>12}</span>
</p>

<p>
He cannot too gratefully acknowledge the kind
assistance heartily given by the Rev. George Wisely, D.D.,
Malta; the Rev. John Mactaggart, Edinburgh; and the
Rev. Alexander Stirling, York, army chaplains.  Their
contributions have been invaluable.
</p>

<p>
So fully indeed has material been placed at the author's
disposal, that the volume might have been easily extended
beyond its present limits.  But enough, it may be hoped,
has been said in illustration of General Wauchope's career
as a soldier, and his character as a man, to enable his
fellow-countrymen to realise that in his lamented death
the nation has lost one of its bravest and best.

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p class="t3">
THE WAUCHOPES OF NIDDRIE MARISCHAL
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Andrew Gilbert Wauchope came of a long line of
ancestry, who have distinguished themselves as soldiers,
as churchmen, or in the more commonplace capacity of
country gentlemen.
</p>

<p>
The family history can be traced back for several
centuries at least, as occupying in the immediate vicinity
of Edinburgh the estate of Niddrie Marischal; and throughout
the various troubles in which Scottish history has been
involved, the Lairds of Niddrie had their fair share,
forfeitures and restorations being an experience not
uncommon in their career.
</p>

<p>
Glancing over their genealogy, one might almost say
with truth that the Wauchopes have ever been a fighting
race, holding opinions strongly, and as strongly asserting
them by word or deed when occasion arose.
</p>

<p>
The very name of their estate has a smack of the
military in it, if it is true, as Celtic scholars say, that
'Niddrie' is derived from the Gaelic <i>Niadh</i> and <i>Ri</i>&mdash;signifying,
in the British form of Celtic, the king's champion.
Then the addition to the word, as distinguishing it
from several other Niddries in Scotland, of Marischal,
Marishal, or Merschell appears to have been given to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P14"></a>14}</span>
estate from the fact that the Wauchopes of Niddrie were
in early times hereditary bailies to Keith Lords Marischal,
and later, Marischal-Deputies in Midlothian, in the reign
of James v.
</p>

<p>
Whether it be true, as stated by Mackenzie in his <i>Lives
of Eminent Scotsmen</i>, that the Wauchopes had their first rise
in the reign of Malcolm Caenmore, and that they came
from France, we shall not stay to discuss; but it is generally
allowed that the name is a local patronymic, common in
the south of Scotland, and that the Wauchopes of Niddrie
Marischal belonged originally to Wauchopedale in
Roxburghshire, where they were for long vassals of the Earls
of Douglas.
</p>

<p>
The records of the earlier generations of the family
having been lost, one cannot with accuracy say who was
its founder, or when he lived.  In James the Second's reign,
for making an inroad into England, and again in Queen
Mary's time, for espousing the cause of that unfortunate
sovereign, the estate of Niddrie was confiscated and passed
for a time into the hands of others, while the feu-charters
that remained were afterwards destroyed when the English
under Oliver Cromwell came to Scotland.  But notwithstanding
these misfortunes, there are documents extant
which go to show that as far back as the time of Robert III.,
who began to reign in 1390, there was one Gilbert Wauchope
holding the lands of Niddrie from that king, who is supposed
to be the grandson of <i>Thomas Wauchope in the county of
Edinburgh</i>, mentioned in the Ragman Rolls of 1296.
</p>

<p>
One scion of the family, born about the year 1500, in the
reign of James IV. attained to considerable distinction as
an ecclesiastic.  This was Robert, the famous Archbishop
of Armagh, a younger son of Archibald, the Laird of
Niddrie.  Defective in his vision almost to blindness, he was,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P15"></a>15}</span>
notwithstanding this misfortune, possessed of great natural
abilities, and by diligent study attained to high and varied
accomplishments.  So proficient did he become in the
study of the Scriptures, the Fathers, and the Councils, that
he was appointed Doctor of Divinity in the University of
Paris; and in 1535, having attracted the notice of Pope
Paul III., he was called to Rome, and employed by him
as legate to the Emperor of Germany and the King of
France, in both of which commissions he is said to have
exhibited the highest qualifications as an ambassador.
Some time after he was promoted to be Archbishop of
Armagh, in Ireland.  There he laboured with incredible
pains to enlighten the ignorant natives, travelling about
his diocese, and often preaching to them four or five
times a week.  Archbishop Wauchope found scope for his
great talents at the Council of Trent.  This famous council,
called together by the Pope to counteract the influence of
the Reformation initiated by Luther in Germany, met in
March 1544, and continued its sittings till 1551.  The
archbishop not only took a part in its proceedings, but
wrote a full account of them, a labour which, however,
proved too much for his strength, for he died at Paris on
his way home on 9th November 1551.  He appears to
have been held by his contemporaries in high admiration.
Lesley says: 'Such was his judgment in secular affairs, that
few of his age came near him,' and in his capacity as legate
'he acquitted himself so well that every one admired his
wit, judgment, and experience.'
</p>

<p>
Sir James Ware, speaking of him in a similar strain, and
alluding, like Lesley, to his having been born blind, says:
'He was sent legate <i>a latere</i> from the Pope to Germany,
from whence came the German proverb, "a blind legate
to the sharp-sighted Germans."'

Some ancestors
</span>
</p>

<p>
Robert's elder brother, Gilbert Wauchope, was meanwhile
Laird of Niddrie, acquiring more property, extending
his borders, and getting himself involved in the local feuds
peculiar to the time of James V.; that king on one occasion,
April 1535, having to grant a letter of protection in favour
of him 'and his wife and bairns' against Sir Patrick
Hepburn of Wauchtonne and thirty-four others for 'umbesetting
the highway for his slaughter.'  In this quarrel, even
the Pope was called upon to interfere in the interest of
peace and safety.  In 1539 Paul III. put forth a mandate
to the Dean of the Church of Restalrig, stating that a
beloved son, a noble man, Gilbert Wauchope, lord in
temporals of the place of Niddriffmarschall, within the
diocese of St. Andrews, had represented to the Pope that
some sons of iniquity, whom he was altogether ignorant of,
had wickedly brought many and heavy losses upon the
said Gilbert Wauchope by concealing the boundaries and
limits or marches of the piece of land or place called
Quhitinche, feued to him by the Abbot and Convent of the
Monastery of the Holy Cross (Holyrood)....  Therefore
the Pope intrusted to the discretion of the said Venerable
Dean and Commissary to admonish publicly in churches,
before the people, ... all holders, etc., and to discover
and restore these to the said Gilbert Wauchope or to the
Abbot of the Monastery, under a general sentence of
excommunication against these persons, till suitable
satisfaction was made.
</p>

<p>
But the Reformation brought many changes, upsetting
the laws, customs, and opinions held sacred for centuries.
The sons no longer walked in the ways of their fathers,
but began to think for themselves.  And so we find that
Gilbert, the son of the laird who had sought and obtained
protection from the Pope, renounced the Pope and took
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P17"></a>17}</span>
an active part in promoting the Reformation.  He was
present at Knox's first sermon at St. Andrews in 1547.
And at the conference of notables that afterwards was held,
where Knox and his preaching were fully discussed, and
Wauchope was asked what he thought of the Reformer,
'this answer gave the Laird of Nydre&mdash;"a man fervent and
uprycht in religioun."'  This Gilbert Wauchope of Niddrie
was a member of the famous Parliament, held at
Edinburgh in August 1560, by which the Reformation was
established.
</p>

<p>
Later on we have a George Wauchope, a celebrated
Professor of Civil Law at Caen, in Normandy, who was a
grandson of Gilbert, and who in 1595, when he was about
twenty-five years of age, wrote <i>A Treatise concerning the
Ancient People of Rome</i>.
</p>

<p>
But the early Wauchopes were a wonderfully varied
class of men, who could take their share of fighting when
necessary; and towards the close of the sixteenth century
their feuds, their 'slauchters,' and political partisanship
well-nigh led to their extinction.  The feuds with the
neighbouring Hepburns and Edmonstons were the occasion of
many unhappy conflicts, while their adhesion to the cause
of Queen Mary for a time brought ruin on the family.
Professor Aytoun, in his poem of 'Bothwell,' referring to
Bothwell's attempt to intercept the Queen on her way
from Stirling and carry her to Dunbar Castle, says:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Hay, bid the trumpets sound the march,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, Bolton, to the van;<br />
  Young Niddrie follows with the rear;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set forward every man.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The estate of Niddrie is quite close to Craigmillar
Castle, where Mary frequently resided, and in all
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P18"></a>18}</span>
probability the fascination of her character brought the
Wauchopes into frequent contact with her, and led them
to espouse her cause when many of the leaders of the
Scottish nobility had declared against her.  We find,
therefore, that Robert Wauchope and his son Archibald
are mentioned in the 'charge agains personis denuncit
rebellis' in June 1587.  This Archibald appears to have
been a youth of wonderful pugnacity, and to have got
himself continually involved in trouble with the authorities for
breaches of the peace, out of which he as often extricated
himself, with no little cleverness.  Once, in 1588, for an
attempted 'slauchter' of 'umquhile James Giffert, and
Johne Edmonston,' the adjoining laird, he was arrested,
tried, and warded in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh; but 'no
pardoun being granted' by the king, 'and about a
thousand persouns in the Tolbuith waiting upon the event,
the candles were put furth about ellevin houres at night,
and Nidrie and his complices escaped out at the windowes.'  It
is a curious reflection upon the Wauchopes of this time
that their name should be associated with the wild Clan
Gregor of Perthshire as disturbers of the peace.  King
James VI. was married in 1590 to the Princess Anne of
Denmark.  On the 1st May the king and queen landed
at Leith, amid a great concourse of loyal subjects, 'and
with volleys of cannon, and orations in their
welcome.'  James had been absent from Scotland more than six
months, and it was remarked at the time, and came to be
memorable afterwards, that these months were a time of
universal peace and good order in Scotland.  'The only
notable exceptions,' according to Spottiswood, 'had been
a riot in Edinburgh by Wauchope of Niddry, and an
outbreak of the Clan Gregor in Balquhidder.'
</p>

<p>
In connection with this, we find Wauchope charged
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P19"></a>19}</span>
by the Privy Council (7th January 1590), 'along with all
other keepers of the places and fortalices of Rossyth and
Nudry,' to deliver the same to the officer executing these
letters, within six hours after charge, under penalty of
treason; the said officer to fence the goods and rents
belonging to Wauchope, which are ordered to remain under
arrest at the instance of the King's Treasurer, 'aye and
quhill he be tryit foule or clene of sic crymes quharof he is
dilaitet.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Attack on Holyroodhouse
</span>
</p>

<p>
Not to mention other scrapes of a similar kind, Archibald
Wauchope was implicated in the attack on the palace
of Holyroodhouse, 27th December 1591, and for this and
other misdemeanours he was forfeited, along with the Earl
of Bothwell and others, and had to leave the country for a
time.  He afterwards came to an untimely end by falling
from a window in Skinner's Close in Edinburgh, about
the year 1596.
</p>

<p>
It was apparently about this period that the old house
or tower of Niddrie Marischal&mdash;'so commodious that it
could garrison a hundred men'&mdash;was destroyed by the
enemies of the family.
</p>

<p>
For some years the estate was in the hands of Sir James
Sandilands of Slamannan, until 1608, when, through the
good graces of James VI., it was restored to Francis, son
of Archibald Wauchope, a restitution which was confirmed
by Act of Parliament in 1609.  Francis (usually styled Sir
Francis Wauchope) appears to have done a good deal for
the estate, but his son, Sir John Wauchope, may be
regarded as the chief restorer of the house of Niddrie.  He
was frugal in his living, and he added several adjoining
properties to the estate by purchase, and received the
honour of knighthood from Charles I. on his visit to
Scotland in 1633.  He was an intimate friend of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P20"></a>20}</span>
notorious Duke of Lauderdale in their younger days, living
with him, and spoken of as 'his bed-fellow.'
</p>

<p>
Sir John exercised great judgment in the management
of his affairs; so much so, that in 1661 he acquired by
purchase the border estate of Yetholm or Lochtour, in
Roxburghshire, which has remained in the family ever
since.  He was present in London at the coronation of
Charles II.; in 1663 he was elected a member of the
Scottish Parliament, and one of the Committee for the
Plantation of Kirks; and in 1678 was a member of the
Convention of Estates.
</p>

<p>
Other lairds appear in succession as the years rolled on.
There are Williams, Andrews, Gilberts, Roberts, following
one another as the leaves succeed in the spring to those
that have fallen in the autumn, but it is not our purpose to
follow their story.  One fought and fell at Killiecrankie
with Viscount Dundee in 1689; another fought for the
Stuarts at the Revolution, and afterwards rose to high
command in the French and Spanish services; and though
the Wauchopes took no active part in the Stuart risings
of 1715 and 1745, their sympathies were all for the exiled
race.
</p>

<p>
In Niddrie House there are to be seen full-length
portraits of Charles I. and his queen; four small
half-lengths of the Chevalier and his consort, and their two
sons, Prince Charles Edward and the Cardinal York, as
boys.  These are understood to have been forwarded
direct from the Chevalier himself to the Niddrie family as
an acknowledgment of their loyalty, and the assistance&mdash;pecuniary
and otherwise&mdash;which the royal line of Stuart
had received at their hands.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A 'Minden' hero
</span>
</p>

<p>
To come to more recent times, we find that Andrew
Wauchope of Niddrie&mdash;the great-grandfather of the subject
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P21"></a>21}</span>
of our sketch, born about the year 1736&mdash;was a captain in
the First Regiment of Dragoon Guards, and fought at the
battle of Minden in Westphalia, where in 1759 the French
were defeated by an army of Anglo-Hanoverian troops.
He lived to a good old age, for it was he who was alluded
to by Sir Walter Scott in the ballad written on the occasion
of the visit of George IV. to Scotland in 1822:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Come, stately Niddrie, auld and true,<br />
  Girt with the sword that Minden knew;<br />
  We have owre few sic lairds as you,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carle, now the King's come.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
This Andrew Wauchope married, in 1786, Alicia, daughter
of William Baird, Newbyth, and sister of the celebrated
Sir David Baird, the hero of Seringapatam, who a few
years afterwards&mdash;in 1805&mdash;commanded the expedition
to the Cape of Good Hope which, after a decisive victory
over the Dutch, received, on 6th January 1806, the
surrender of the colony to Great Britain.  There were
nine children of this marriage, five boys and four girls.
The eldest, Andrew, was killed in 1813 at the battle of the
Pyrenees while in command of the 20th Regiment of Foot,
and so the second son, William, succeeded to the property,
old Andrew Wauchope having resigned it in his favour in
1817, retaining for himself the liferent.
</p>

<p>
William Wauchope, who had the year before married
Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Robert Baird of Newbyth,
and niece of the then Marchioness of Breadalbane, was a
lieutenant-colonel in the army.  Curiously enough, William's
younger brother, Admiral Robert Wauchope, was stationed
at Cape Town at the beginning of the century, where he
resided for many years with his wife.  They knew the
Dutch well, and were on the most friendly terms with both
Dutch and English settlers in the colony.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P22"></a>22}</span>
</p>

<p>
William Wauchope died in 1826, leaving a family of two,
the eldest of whom, Andrew Wauchope, born in 1818,
being then a minor, succeeded to the property.  His sister,
Hersey Susan Sydney, was married in 1842 to George
Elliot, captain, Royal Navy, eldest son of the Hon. Admiral
Elliot.  Andrew Wauchope, the father of the subject of
our memoir, was for a time in the army&mdash;an officer in the
dragoons; but, being of a delicate constitution, he retired
after his marriage to reside at Niddrie, where he was long
known and respected as a kind and indulgent landlord,
ever ready to give a helping hand to his tenants or to
religious and philanthropic objects.  He did a great deal
towards completing the extensive improvements begun by
his father on the house and grounds of Niddrie.
</p>

<p>
The newer part of the house, forming the north-east
wing, was erected by William Wauchope about seventy-five
years ago.  It contains some handsome apartments, and
it is interesting to note that the celebrated Hugh Miller,
when a lad, was employed (in 1823) as a mason at the
work, and is said to have carved a number of the
ornamental chimneys which form a distinctive feature of a
most picturesque edifice.  What the father began, the
son ultimately completed.  The park was extended, new
approaches and avenues were formed, lodges erected, and
gardens and vineries laid out&mdash;the whole place being
transformed into one of the most beautiful country seats
to be found in the county of Midlothian.  These somewhat
extensive works, resumed by the father of the General
about the year 1850, were steadily carried on year by year
until his death, 22nd November 1874, for he took much
pride in the work, and made it his life hobby.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sir William Wallace
</span>
</p>

<p>
So far this brief genealogy of General Wauchope's family
has been traced through the male line, but it would be
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P23"></a>23}</span>
incomplete and lacking in public interest, did we not also
refer to his descent on the female side from the family of
Sir William Wallace, the champion of Scottish freedom.
This interesting connection is traced to James Wauchope,
the grandfather of the 'Minden' hero.  In 1710 he
married Jane, daughter of Sir William Wallace, Bart, of
Craigie, near Ayr, whose eldest son, Andrew, succeeded
his cousin in 1726, and in his line the property has
remained to the present time.

</p>

<p>
Over the fireplace of the dining-room of Niddrie House
there is a painting on canvas inserted in panelling said to
be a portrait of 'Wallace Wight.'  It has been in possession
of the family for nearly two hundred years, being mentioned
in various inventories of the property from the year
1707.  An interesting notice of it appeared in James
Paterson's <i>Wallace and his Times</i>, and the family tradition
is that it is a genuine portrait of the hero, the words
inscribed above the likeness, 'Gvl: Wallas: Scotvs: Host:
ivm: Terror,' certainly giving colour to the supposition.
We are more inclined to think, however, that the portrait
represents one of the more immediate ancestors of the
Jane Wallace who brought the connection into the family&mdash;probably
Sir William Wallace of Craigie, who distinguished
himself as a loyalist in the civil wars.  It certainly came
into the family through the marriage of James Wauchope
in 1710 with Jane, daughter of Sir William Wallace of
Craigie, and if it does not represent the champion of
Scottish independence, it is from the same source as a
similar portrait preserved at Priory Lodge, Cheltenham, in
the hands of a descendant of the Craigie-Wallace family.
</p>

<p>
It was when he was serving with his regiment at Monaghan,
in Ireland, that the father of General Wauchope first met his
future wife, Frances Maria, daughter of Henry Lloyd of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P24"></a>24}</span>
Lloydsburgh, County Tipperary.  They were married on
26th March 1840, and two sons and two daughters were
the issue of the marriage.  These were&mdash;

<p>
A typical Scotsman, loyal to the backbone to the land of
his birth, Andrew Gilbert Wauchope had always a warm
corner in his heart for Ireland, and was ever ready to
acknowledge, and indeed to boast of, his Irish extraction.
Combining as he did much of the canniness of the Scot
with that steady-going determination of purpose and
fearlessness in danger peculiar to his countrymen, he displayed
the Irish side of his character in that generous
light-heartedness and impulsive good nature which often led him
into self-denying deeds of kindness, and now and again
into trouble.  General Wauchope was, as we have seen,
the heir to no mean family traditions.  The record of the
Wauchopes is one of patriotic energy through five or six
hundred years of stirring Scottish history, many of them years
of turmoil and strife; and the warlike spirit of the fathers,
as well as their more peaceful characteristics, may be found
not infrequently imaged in this last scion of the race.

<p class="intro">
CHILDHOOD&mdash;EARLY TENDENCIES&mdash;THE 'HOUSEHOLD
TROOP'&mdash;EDUCATION&mdash;NAVAL TRAINING&mdash;THE 'BRITANNIA'&mdash;THE
'ST. GEORGE'&mdash;PRINCE ALFRED.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
General Wauchope's boyhood was spent mostly at
Niddrie, with occasional short visits in summer to the
other property of the family at Yetholm, among the
pastoral Cheviot hills.
</p>

<p>
A high-spirited, frolicsome boy, delighting in the open
air and every kind of outdoor sport, 'Andy,' as he was
familiarly called, found scope for his energies in the
beautifully wooded park surrounding the house.  Bird-nesting,
rabbit-catching, and fishing in the burn which meanders
through the estate, found him an ardent enthusiast, but
often brought him into trouble with his father and mother.
His bird-nesting feats, prosecuted with all the zest of a
professional poacher, often resulted in the dislocation of
his clothes, and shoes and stockings too often betrayed the
fact that friendly visits to the burn were more frequent and
prolonged than ought to be.  Many a time Andy was thus
in a sore plight.  Drenched and torn, he would go to
the kindly gardener's wife, to get the rents in his jacket
sewed, his stockings changed, and his shoes dried, before
venturing into the family presence.  In his adventures
over the property, the burn was never a barrier to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P26"></a>26}</span>
progress.  It was the same with hedges, ditches, or stone
walls.  If he wanted to reach a certain point, he made a
straight road to it over every obstacle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Youthful tendencies
</span>
</p>

<p>
But the limits of the park did not always satisfy his
roving desires.  He soon made himself acquainted with
the surroundings of his home.  Craigmillar Castle was a
favourite resort on the one side; the beach at Portobello
gave him a taste for the sea and aquatic exercise; while the
neighbouring little village of Niddrie was not long in
making his acquaintance.  Here he was known to every
one, for Andy made himself at home in every cottage; and
if the boys stood in some awe of him, and mothers blamed
him for sending their sons home with their clothes torn,
or their noses bleeding, still, for all that, he was always
welcomed among them, sometimes with a 'jeelie' (jelly)
piece or a new-baked scone!
</p>

<p>
Many a frolic he and the boys of the village were engaged
in, if all tales were told, and sometimes Andy got credit
for more than he deserved.  Boys will be boys, but his
boyhood early showed the spirit of the man, for to have a
number of country boys together, and put them through
military drill, was the height of his delight.  He was a
born leader, and he doubtless imbibed his love of
soldiering from the frequent opportunities he had of seeing
military manoeuvres in the Queen's Park, or more likely
on Portobello sands, where at that time there was a great
deal of drilling, both of the regulars and of the yeomanry
cavalry.  That the military instinct revealed itself early may
be gathered from the following:&mdash;One day the village
dominie, worthy old Mr. Savage, looking out of the school
door across the road, saw the youthful form of Andy&mdash;then
about seven or eight years old&mdash;on the top of the high
boundary wall of his father's park, which at that place is
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P27"></a>27}</span>
nearly nine feet high.  'What are you doing up there?'
shouted the dominie; 'get down at once, you young
rascal, or you'll get killed!'  But Andy only waved his
hand as he shouted back, 'It's all right, Mr. Savage: I'm
only viewing the enemy,' and off he scampered along the
top of the wall!
</p>

<p>
Andy's 'household troop' was not a large one, but it
sufficed.  With Tom and Jim, the gardener's sons, and their
sisters, Jess and Bella, assisted by a few male and female
recruits from among the children of the other workers, with
his sister Fanny and his cousins Elizabeth and Nina Elliot,
now Lady Northesk and Mrs. J. Dacre Butler respectively&mdash;one
of whom carried the banner, and another the drum&mdash;the
youthful general managed to make a fair show.  He drilled
them well, and was naturally very proud of them.  One day
there happened to be company at the house.  Andy, anxious
to display his forces, marched them up to the front door,
and there, seated on his little black pony 'Donald,' he put
them through their facings, to the great entertainment of
the visitors.  He was not content with this, however.  He
must needs take the place by storm, and so, putting
himself at the head of his troop, he gave the word of command,
'Forward, march!' and actually marched them into the
hall, and through the dining-room to the terrace at the
back of the house, bravely leading them on his pony!
</p>

<p>
The ice-house stood in the park not very far from the
house.  It was a vaulted chamber covered with turf,
forming externally a mound which made a capital fort.  Many
a time was it the scene of mimic warfare, its defence or
assault giving splendid scope for the youthful general's
military genius,&mdash;brilliant attacks being as brilliantly
defeated without any great loss of life!
</p>

<p>
Sometimes 'Andy's' attacks took a wider range, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P28"></a>28}</span>
nocturnal escapades of a frolicking nature are said to have
been not infrequent.  It is told of him that having gathered
a few of the village boys together, they made a raid one
night upon the workshop of the village joiner, and took
away a number of odd cart-wheels lying about in the yard.
These they fastened to the doors of some of the cottages,
where they were found next morning, much to the surprise
of the inmates, who had some difficulty in getting
egress from their houses!  Nobody, of course, could tell
who was to blame; but, as our informant remarked, 'They
a' kent wha did it: it was just some o' Maister Andra's
mischief.'
</p>

<p>
One old woman in the village, whose temper was not
very good, and who laboured under the conviction that
her hen-house was from time to time robbed of its
roosters, had made herself somewhat obnoxious, and it
was determined to give her a real fright.  So one evening,
after all decent folks were supposed to be in bed, Andy
and his company slipped quietly round to the hen-house,
and presently there was a great commotion and cackling
among the feathered occupants.  The old lady in her bed
heard it all, but was too frightened to come to the rescue.
She was certain, however, that some of her favourite hens
had been taken, and next day she went up to the laird at
the big house to complain, and to ask compensation.  Andy
was with his father when the old woman was laying off her
story, but betrayed no signs of his complicity in the
transaction, wisely preferring to keep his own counsel in the
matter.  Of course the boys had taken none of her
property.  They only wanted to play a trick upon her.
</p>

<p>
Andy was, however, not a boy who would perpetrate
any wilful mischief, or do anything that would cause pain.
He hated cruelty, and once when he was accused of having
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P29"></a>29}</span>
killed the cat of an old servant of the family, who lived as
a pensioner in the village, he heard the accusation with
the greatest indignation.  Going at once to Mary's house he
strongly asserted his innocence, telling her with all
earnestness, 'I'd rather shoot myself, as shoot your cat, Mary.'
</p>

<p>
Very early in life he evinced a strong desire to share
in the sport of the hunting-field.  His father would not,
however, hear of it, and refused to allow him to get a
proper rig-out.  But Master Andrew was not to be balked
in his ambition, for one morning, getting into a pair of his
father's top-boots, many sizes too large for him, and securing
the biggest horse in the stables, he boldly set off for the
hunt.  The appearance of such a mite with boots that
would scarcely keep on his feet, on the back of a big
hunter, created great laughter among the county gentry
at the meet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Early education
</span>
</p>

<p>
During these early years of Wauchope's life, so free from
restraint, his education was being carried on at home under
a tutor.  At the age of eleven he was sent to a school at
Worksop, in Nottinghamshire, but he did not remain there
very long.  He had a hankering for active life, and specially
for the sea.  It was accordingly resolved to prepare him
for entering the navy as a midshipman, and he was sent
to Foster's School, Stubbington House, Gosport.  His
experience here was also a short one, and was marked
by an incident characteristic of his spirit of adventure
and faithfulness to obligations; though in this case we
must say the latter virtue was rather misapplied, and it
might well be said 'his faith unfaithful kept him falsely
true.'  The boys at Foster's, evidently wanting to vary the
monotony of school life&mdash;perhaps none of the brightest&mdash;thought
it would be a good lark if one would run away
from the school, and they resolved to draw lots who it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P30"></a>30}</span>
should be.  The lot fell upon young Andy Wauchope, and,
like the loyal lad he was, he resolutely stuck to the
agreement and ran off from the school, but of course he was
promptly brought back by his people, and no doubt
received the just reward of his frolic!
</p>

<p>
He used to say long afterwards that he had only been
at two schools when he was a boy.  'At one of them he
was said to be the best boy in the school, but at the other
he was the very worst!'
</p>

<p>
With what would now be considered a very inadequate
training, young Wauchope was on the 10th September
1859 entered as a naval cadet on board Her Majesty's
ship <i>Britannia</i>, there to pick up in the rough school of
a sailor's life that knowledge of the world, and particularly
of his naval duties, which books and schooling had denied
him.  At the same time, though deprived of the advantages
of Eton or Harrow, or any of the Scottish Universities,
he had a much better gift than education&mdash;an
immense natural shrewdness, and a persevering
application, which afterwards made him a good French and
German scholar.  Among his shipmates on the <i>Britannia</i>
he was a general favourite.  He was only thirteen years
of age, but appears to have been a plucky little fellow,
full of life and fun, and quite capable of standing up
for himself, or for a friend if need be; and in the
thirteen months of his service in the ship he made several
lifelong friendships.  Admiral Lord Charles Beresford,
writing to us of that period, mentions that he and
Wauchope joined the navy about the same time.  'I
remember,' he says, 'our chests were close together in the
<i>Britannia</i>.  We separated when we went to sea, but we
never lost the friendship we formed in the <i>Britannia</i>.  We
met often in different parts of the world, and I always
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P31"></a>31}</span>
found him the same sterling, honest, strong, and chivalrous
friend, whose splendid characteristics had so impressed me
as a boy.  I have always regarded his friendship for me
with sentiments of pride.  He was very proud of being a
Scotsman, and being an Irishman myself, we had many
arguments&mdash;as boys will have&mdash;as to which nation
possessed the most interesting personalities.  We agreed
cordially on every other point, but never once on this.
The nation has lost one of its best in poor Andy
Wauchope.'  There are doubtless others of his <i>Britannia</i>
shipmates surviving who could give similar testimony.
</p>

</p>

<p>
On the 5th October 1860, Wauchope received his discharge
from the <i>Britannia</i>, and was entered as a midshipman
on board H.M.S. <i>St. George</i>, and he mentions himself
with what pride and satisfaction he found himself on that
autumn day walking down the main street of Portsmouth
in his new uniform to join the <i>St. George</i>.  'It was one of
the happiest days of my life,' he says; 'a day in which I
felt myself identified as an officer in Her Majesty's service,
more particularly as on the way down to the harbour I was
met and saluted by one of the marines.'
</p>

<p>
The <i>St. George</i> was manned by eight hundred men, and
in 1860 was considered a well-equipped vessel, and as
compared with the days of Nelson and Collingwood
showed a great advance in naval strength and efficiency.
At Trafalgar the biggest gun in the whole British fleet was
only a fifty-six pounder, but the <i>St. George</i> had in addition
to a number of that calibre several sixty-eight pounders,
while her speed of ten knots an hour was considered
highly satisfactory.  Though these equipments would not
bear comparison with present-day standards, the young
midshipman was proud of his ship and proud of the
service, and in after years could with no little exultation
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P32"></a>32}</span>
honestly say that, 'though armaments had changed, the
hearts of oak remained as of yore; while the old red rag,
which had withstood the battle and the breeze for a
thousand years, was still able to claim the allegiance of
its people.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
H.R.H. Prince Alfred
</span>
</p>

<p>
Wauchope's commanding officer on board the <i>St. George</i>
was Captain the Hon. Francis Egerton&mdash;whose
son, Commander Egerton, was killed at Ladysmith in
November 1899&mdash;and among his brother officers were
H.R.H. Prince Alfred, afterwards the Duke of Edinburgh,
and latterly known as the Duke of Saxe-Coburg Gotha,
and Admiral Sir Robert Harris, now Commander-in-Chief
of the Cape of Good Hope station.
</p>

<p>
The <i>St. George</i> was commissioned at Portsmouth, and
was transferred to Devonport early in 1861.  She was then
one of the noblest and most imposing-looking ships of the
service, having the year before been thoroughly overhauled
and converted from a one hundred and twenty gun ship to
one of ninety guns.  As a three-decker sailing ship she
was considered one of the finest fighting vessels afloat,
and her conversion to a steamship of the line had been
attended with the most successful results.  She was selected
by Prince Albert for his son, the youthful Prince Alfred, who
joined her as a midshipman a few months after Wauchope&mdash;on
the 16th January 1861&mdash;as she lay in Plymouth
Sound, under orders for a cruise to the British North
American Stations and the West India Islands.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of the year seems to have been spent in
and about Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, which
became a centre for cruises in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and
the Canadian ports.  We have it on the authority of several
of those who were midshipmen with the Prince, that they
were a jovial, happy company, all on the most friendly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P33"></a>33}</span>
terms with one another.  The Prince, who was very fond
of 'Andy,' as he was always called, showed him particular
friendship, and the affection which as boys and shipmates
they formed then continued more or less in later
years.
</p>

<p>
The Prince came back to England in the month of
August to spend a short holiday with his parents at
Balmoral, but rejoined his ship, which was lying at Halifax, in
October.  His return was welcomed by his mates and by
the citizens of that town; and the Governor, the Earl of
Mulgrave, entertained His Royal Highness and the officers
of the <i>St. George</i> at a state dinner on the eve of their
departure for a cruise to Bermuda.  Among the sunny
islands of the South the ship and her crew were everywhere
received with the utmost enthusiasm, the black and white
population alike vying with each other in their demonstrations
of loyalty; but the sudden death of the Prince
Consort at the end of December compelled the return
home for a time of Prince Alfred, who left his ship at
Halifax on receipt of the sad news, with every expression
of sympathy from his brother officers.  In the spring of
1862 Wauchope's ship paid another visit to the West
India Islands, taking up her station for some weeks
with other six ships of the line at Bermuda, where the
young 'middies' were entertained to a continued round of
amusements and excursions.
</p>

<p>
A seafaring life, if often one of risks and toil, has its
seasons of enforced idleness.  Midshipmen's amusements
and practical jokes are proverbial, and the quarter-deck of
the <i>St. George</i> was not always free of them.  Many pranks
were played upon one another in idle hours by these
sprightly young officers, leading sometimes to reprimands
by their superiors; and young Andy Wauchope did not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P34"></a>34}</span>
always escape the suspicion that he was an active leader in
such ploys.  It has even been hinted that he had on one
occasion the pluck&mdash;or, shall we say, audacity?&mdash;to have a
stand-up fight with the Queen's son.  We do not vouch
for the story; but of this we are certain, that, if he had
a just cause of quarrel, he was not the boy to let even the
prestige of royalty stand between him and the punishment
due to the aggressor, whoever he might be.
</p>

<p>
Some years afterwards, in the winter of 1863-64, when
Prince Alfred resided at Holyrood Palace, and was a
student of Edinburgh University, he paid a friendly visit to
his old shipmate at Niddrie, spending the day in
pigeon-shooting.  He and a number of his friends arrived in the
forenoon on horseback, and the identity of the party not
having been made known to the keeper of the Niddrie
toll, through which they had to pass to reach the house, he
peremptorily insisted upon payment.  But being told that
it was the Queen's son going to see the laird, his loyalty so
much got the better of him that he would not take a
copper.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon the party adjourned to the park to have
some shooting.  Mr. Wauchope, 'Andy's' father, was with
them, and was persuaded to try a shot, but unfortunately
the piece went off in his hand before he could take aim,
and one of the footmen in attendance was hit in the arm
by the charge.  Mr. Wauchope was so distressed over the
accident that he vowed he would never again take a gun
in his hand.

</p>

<p>
But it was not in the navy that young Wauchope was
destined to distinguish himself.  It has been said that the
severity and even harshness of the naval discipline gave
him a distaste of the service, and drove him from it.
Possibly some remarks he made on one occasion as to his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P35"></a>35}</span>
having been unjustly punished for some petty offence may
have given some colour to this supposition.  We rather
incline to accept the explanation of a brother officer, who
asked him afterwards why he left the navy.  His reply
was, 'for no reason except that his father wished him, and
that his father desired that he should have a naval training
before he entered the army.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The St. George
</span>
</p>

<p>
The experience gained at sea was certainly not lost, for
his father's wisdom furnished him with a dual equipment
which in after years was not infrequently of value.  The
injustice of the punishment he received when in the
<i>St. George</i>, whatever it may have been, certainly impressed
itself upon him to this extent, that later in life he made it
a rule never to punish a soldier until thoroughly satisfied
of his guilt, and he always was inclined to give a man the
benefit of a doubt.
</p>

<p>
The <i>St. George</i> returned home in the beginning of July
1862 from her long cruise in American waters, and with
her return young Wauchope closed his naval career.  The
official Admiralty record simply states that 'on the 3rd of
July 1862 Midshipman Wauchope was discharged from the
service at his own request, in order that he might qualify
for the army.'  His whole naval experience, therefore,
covered a period of scarcely three years, but it gave him a
knowledge of men and things, and a knowledge of the
world, better, perhaps, than any study of books could
afford.

<p class="intro">
ENTERS THE ARMY&mdash;THE BLACK WATCH&mdash;ASHANTI
WAR&mdash;RETURN HOME&mdash;BANQUET AT PORTOBELLO.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Young Wauchope had not long to wait for a commission.
At that time positions in the army could only be got by
purchase and strong influence, but he was fortunate in
being enrolled as ensign, in November 1865, in the 42nd
Highlanders, one of the most popular and distinguished
of Scottish regiments, and familiarly known as the 'Black
Watch.'  He was only nineteen years of age at the time when
he joined the regiment at Stirling Castle, and is described
by one of his superiors as then 'a merry, rollicking lad,
full of life and fun.'  'Andy,' as he used to be called
by the officers, and 'Red Mick' more frequently by the
men, was a general favourite; and, notwithstanding his
natural lightness of heart, he had soundness of brain and
judgment enough to know that promotion would only
come to him by diligent study and close application to his
profession.  His commanding officer, Sir John M'Leod,
appears, at all events, to have been struck with the young
man's energy of character and indefatigable 'go,' for he
describes him as at that time 'a particularly energetic
young lad, who thought nothing of walking from Stirling
to Niddrie to see his old father whenever he could get a
few days' leave at a week-end.'  This, he explains, was not
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P37"></a>37}</span>
at all from motives of economy, 'but merely to walk off
superfluous energy.'  Assiduous in the matter of drill,
Wauchope soon became as proficient as his instructor, for
he took a thorough pleasure in the exercise.  The innate
smartness and recklessness of the red-polled ensign at
once endeared him to a grave old Crimean drill-sergeant,
who forthwith charged himself with his training.
Concerning this latest accession to the commissioned strength
of the Black Watch, the man of stripes was wont to
say&mdash;'That red-headed Wauchope chap will either gang tae the
deil, or he'll dee Commander-in-Chief!'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Black Watch
</span>
</p>

<p>
Though the worthy sergeant's prediction has in neither
case been verified, young Wauchope, though at first inclined
to consider his superiors a trifle slow, soon fell into
the steady sober ways of the 42nd, then as now noted for
the gentlemanly conduct of its officers, and the upright
character of its rank and file.  'Step out, shentlemens;
step out.  You're all shentlemens here; if you're not
shentlemens in the Black Watch, you'll not be
shentlemens anywhere.'  Such was the opinion of their old
Highland sergeant as he put them through their drill.  We
have been told that at that time one might be a year
among the officers and never hear an oath uttered, while
smoking and drinking were scarcely known.  Wauchope
was thus fortunate in being, at a critical period of his life,
associated with men who shunned what was vulgar, and
whose influence over him was for good.  In military
matters he early manifested the inquiring mind.  Points
in drill or tactics, which he might not at first understand,
set him thinking, and he would not rest till he got an
explanation of their meaning and object.  Captain Christie,
then adjutant of the Black Watch, lately governor of
Edinburgh Prison, was early taken into the young ensign's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P38"></a>38}</span>
confidence in difficulties of this kind.  Having been
through the hard fighting and the terrible scenes of the
Indian Mutiny, the captain was made frequently to 'fight
his battles o'er again,' explaining the methods and tactics
by which decisive results were attained in the various
engagements.  Never what may be called a great reader
of books, Wauchope had two, however, placed in his hand
by his adjutant when in Stirling Castle, which he studied
assiduously.  These two books&mdash;Macaulay's <i>Essays</i> and
Burke's <i>French Revolution</i>&mdash;he read and re-read, borrowing
them several times, and there is little doubt that the
perusal of them made a deep and lasting impression upon
his mind, going a long way towards the formation of that
strong political sagacity, administrative ability in civil
affairs, and military genius which were displayed on many
occasions in his after-life.
</p>

<p>
In 1867 Wauchope went to Hythe, where he passed in
the Military School of Instruction first-class in musketry,
and in June of that year was promoted to be lieutenant.
So proficient was he found in the matter of drill that, in
spite of his youth, he was appointed to the important
position of adjutant to the regiment in 1870, though still
retaining the rank of lieutenant, a position which he held
with the utmost credit for the next three years.  During
this time he served successively with the 42nd in garrison
duty at Edinburgh, Aldershot, and Devonport.
</p>

<p>
Leaving Edinburgh in 1869 by the transport <i>Orontes</i>,
from Granton to Portsmouth, the regiment reached
Aldershot camp on the 12th November, and was stationed
there for two and a half years.  After taking a part in the
Autumn Manoeuvres at Dartmoor in August 1873, they
were stationed for a few months at the Clarence Barracks,
Portsmouth.  His duties during all these years were of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P39"></a>39}</span>
most arduous and trying description, but his singularly
lovable and attractive nature made him so many friends
that difficulties disappeared before his cheerful
countenance.  Speaking of this period in his career, Colonel
Bayly, afterwards his commanding officer, says&mdash;'It was
very early in his subaltern career that Wauchope was
voted for the appointment of adjutant, and he made one
of the best that had ever been appointed.  His charm of
disposition enabled him to gain the love of his men, whilst
his tact and firmness enabled him to enforce the necessary
discipline.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ashanti war
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the outbreak of the Ashanti war on the west coast
of Africa in the autumn of 1873, young Lieutenant
Wauchope found his first opportunity, in active foreign
service, of showing the metal of which he was made.
</p>

<p>
The king of Ashanti&mdash;Koffee Kalcallee&mdash;the head of a
strong warlike kingdom on the north of the Gold Coast,
had long asserted his authority over the neighbouring
provinces of Akim, Assin, Gaman, and Denkira, down to the
very coast where the Dutch and English had settlements.
The transfer, in 1872, of the Dutch possessions
adjoining Cape Coast Castle to Great Britain for certain
commercial privileges, gave King Koffee of Ashanti the
opportunity for asserting what he considered his lawful
authority over the Fantees or adjoining coast tribe.  This,
however, was only a covert excuse for striking a blow at
British rule on the Gold Coast, and in January 1873 an
army of 60,000 warriors&mdash;and the Ashantis, though cruel,
are brave and warlike&mdash;was in full march upon Cape Coast
Castle and Elmina.  The British force on the spot under
Colonel Harley was only a thousand men, mainly West
India troops and Haussa police, with a few marines; and
though the neighbouring friendly tribes, whose interest it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P40"></a>40}</span>
was to remain under the British protectorate, raised a large
contingent for their own defence, this was a force that
could not be relied on.  By the month of April the
Ashantis had crossed the river Prah, the southern limit
of their kingdom, and were within a few miles of Cape
Coast Castle, and matters were looking serious.  With the
aid of a small reinforcement of marines, the enemy were
fortunately kept at bay until the 2nd October, when a
strong force arrived from England, which turned the tide
against King Koffee, and ultimately swept him and his
warriors back upon his capital.  This expedition, under
Major-General Sir Garnet Wolseley, with his staff and a body
of five hundred sailors and marines, not only held their own,
but by the end of November, after much hard preliminary
work, had forced the king to retreat to Kumasi.  Wolseley,
finding the expedition a more arduous one than was at
first expected, had meantime asked for further reinforcements,
and on the 4th December the Black Watch, accompanied
by a considerable number of volunteers from the
79th, left Portsmouth, arriving on 4th January 1874 at their
destination.  Sir Garnet had now at his disposal a force
consisting of the 23rd, 42nd, and 2nd Battalion Rifle
Brigade, detachments of Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers,
and Royal Marines, which, with native levies, formed a
small but effective army wherewith to advance into the
enemy's country.
</p>

<p>
This was no light task, more especially when the
dangerous nature of the climate is taken into account, and
the necessity there was that the enterprise should be
accomplished, if at all, before the rainy season, with all its
concomitant malaria, set in.  To pierce into the heart of
a country like Ashanti, with its marshes and matted
forests, its pathless jungles and fetid swamps, with a
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P41"></a>41}</span>
cunning foe ever dogging their steps, was the service
imposed on this brave little army of British.  As Lord Derby
remarked at the time, this was to be 'an engineers' and
doctors' war.'  Roads had to be made, bridges built,
telegraphs set up, and camps formed.  But by the energy and
skill of General Wolseley, ably supported by such men as
Captain (now Sir) Redvers Buller, Colonel (afterwards Sir
John) N'Neil, Lieut.-Colonel (afterwards Sir Evelyn) Wood,
Colonel (now Sir John) M'Leod, and others who have
since risen to distinction in the army, the enterprise was
successfully and brilliantly accomplished within a month.
The Ashantis were forced back upon their own territory in
a number of engagements, until at last their capital was
seized and burned to the ground.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Wauchope's black boys
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Wauchope's share in this expedition was
highly creditable to his bravery and military skill.
Accompanying Sir Garnet Wolseley at an early stage of the
struggle, as one of the staff, he resigned his adjutantship of
the Black Watch, and was afterwards fortunate in
obtaining special employment as a commander of one of the
native regiments formed at Cape Coast Castle, namely,
Russell's regiment of Haussas, the Winnebah Company.
To form such crude material into a well-disciplined body
of soldiers seemed at first a well-nigh hopeless
undertaking.  Their fear made cowards of them all.  The very
sight of a gun terrified them, and for long they held their
arms in such superstitious dread, that they would hang
them up in the trees and actually worship them.  But
Wauchope's admirable drilling qualifications stood him in
good stead.  He took, we are told, a great pride in the
training of his 'black boys,' as he called them, and infused
into them much of his own daring spirit.  This appointment
separated him for a time from his own regiment, but on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P42"></a>42}</span>
the Black Watch arriving afterwards at the Gold Coast, he
had frequent opportunities of fighting by their side.
</p>

<p>
In the advanced guard, the 42d Regiment and Russell's
Haussas, under Colonel M'Leod, having crossed the
Adansi hills, reached Prah-su on the 30th January, and
occupied a position about two miles from the Ashanti
main position at Amoaful.  Surmounting innumerable
difficulties, and carrying all before them, the Highlanders
by their dash and intrepidity were a splendid example to
those led by Wauchope, who sometimes had difficulty in
inspiring his men with courage enough to face their
much-dreaded enemy.  In scouting and clearing the
ground his men were, however, invaluable, and if we
consider the dense undergrowth that covered the country
traversed, this was a work of great importance.  By one
traveller we are told 'the country hereabout (at Amoaful)
is one dense mass of brush, penetrated by a few narrow
lanes, where the ground, hollowed by rains, is so uneven
and steep at the sides as to give scanty footing.  A
passenger between the two walls of foliage may wander for
hours before he finds that he has mistaken the path.  To
cross the country from one narrow clearing to another, axes
and knives must be used at every step.  There is no
looking over the hedge in this oppressive and bewildering
maze.'  It was in such a position as this that the battle of
Amoaful was fought.  The enemy's army was never seen
in open order, but its numbers are reported by Ashantis
to have been from fifteen to twenty thousand.  After a
stubborn day's fight in the entanglement of the forest, the
Ashantis were finally defeated with great loss.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Attack on Kumasi
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 1st February, the day following this important
engagement, orders were issued for an attack upon
Becquah, towards which Captain Buller and Lord Gifford
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P43"></a>43}</span>
scouted at daybreak.  The attack was intrusted to Sir
Archibald Alison, who had under his orders the Naval Brigade,
one gun and one rocket detachment, Rait's Artillery,
detachment of Royal Engineers, with labourers, 23rd Fusiliers,
five companies of 42nd Highlanders, and Russell's regiment
of Haussas, with scouts.  This force was divided into an
advanced guard and main body, and Wauchope was again
honoured with the post of danger, his regiment of Haussas
being in the advanced guard along with the Naval Brigade
and Rail's Artillery, all under the command of Colonel
M'Leod.  After a toilsome march through the bush under
a tropical sun, the town of Becquah was reached, and a
sharp but decisive engagement took place, the main brunt
of which fell upon Lord Gifford's scouts and the Haussas.
Still pressing on, the intrepid little army, through many
mazy trampings, arrived at Jarbinbah, every inch of the
ground being disputed by the enemy.  Here Wauchope
was wounded in the chest by a slug fired down upon him
from one of the tall trees in the swampy ground in front
of an ambuscade; but, serious enough though it was, and
causing much loss of blood, it did not prevent him sticking
to his post and looking after his 'black boys.'  After this
battle King Koffee sent in a letter to Sir Garnet Wolseley,
with vague promises of an indemnity, hoping to prevent
the invading army approaching his capital; but his previous
prevarications did not admit of his tardy proposals being
for a moment entertained.  The king, realising this, resolved
to dispute the passage of the river Ordah.  The stream was
about fifty feet wide, and waist-deep, and the enemy, to the
number of at least 10,000 men, were posted on the further
side.  Russell's regiment of Haussas was, on the afternoon
of the 3rd February, at once passed to the other side of
the stream as a covering party to the Engineers, who
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P44"></a>44}</span>
were ordered to throw over a bridge.  They rapidly made
entrenchments, and cleared the ground on the north side,
so that the whole advanced guard might successfully cross.
In this affair Lieutenant Wauchope acquitted himself with
much coolness and bravery, notwithstanding his wounded
state, Colonel M'Leod reporting the regiment as 'being in
front the whole day, and having behaved with remarkable
steadiness under trying circumstances, <i>reserving their fire</i>
with remarkable self-control.'  This shows a decided
improvement in the discipline of Wauchope's 'black boys'
from a former despatch, where their firing was characterised
as 'wild.' By daybreak on the morning of the 4th February
the bridge over the Ordah was completed, amid drenching
rain, which had continued all night, and the whole
available force was successfully passed over in spite of the
vigorous resistance of the Ashantis, who, with drums
beating and great shouting, were endeavouring to circle
round the British.  'For the first half-mile from the river
the path rose tolerably even,' says one report; 'then after a
rapid descent it passed along a narrow ridge with a ravine
on each side; dipped again deeply, and then finally rose
into the village.  To the south-west of the village, extending
almost to the village itself, and for a considerable
distance along the road, the enemy had made a clearing of
several acres, by cutting down a plantain-grove.  Colonel
M'Leod steadily advanced along the main road under
cover of a gun, after a few rounds from which the Rifles
made a corresponding advance; then the gun was brought
up again, and another advance made; and in this manner
the village was at last reached and carried.'  The Ashantis
fought well, and with a vigour and pertinacity which won
the praise and admiration of the Highlanders.  The soldiers
were put to their mettle, and even the Haussas, as if
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P45"></a>45}</span>
catching the fierce courage of the Scotsmen, laboured with
vigour and energy not eclipsed by any in the field.  The
dislodgment of the enemy was not effected, however, without
considerable loss, Lieutenant Eyre being killed, while
Wauchope received a second severe wound, this time on
the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Kumasi captured
</span>
</p>

<p>
The battle virtually decided the fate of Kumasi and
King Koffee.  On the news of the defeat of his army the
king fled, no one knew whither, and the victorious General
Wolseley, with his troops, entered the blood-stained capital
in the evening.  Attempts were made to negotiate with
the king.  He preferred to keep in hiding, and after two
days' stay in his capital in order, if possible, to compel
him to come to terms, it was at length resolved to destroy
the place and at once retire to Cape Coast Castle.
Kumasi was burned to the ground on the 6th February,
and the British troops having accomplished their purpose
retraced their steps, and notwithstanding the swollen state
of the rivers&mdash;for the rainy season had just set in&mdash;their
destination was reached in twelve days.  No time was
lost in getting the troops out of the influence of the deadly
climate, and accordingly by the 4th March the whole
expeditionary force was embarked for home.
</p>

<p>
Wauchope's wounds, thanks to a good constitution,
readily healed, and by the time of his arrival at Portsmouth
he was fairly convalescent, though every effort made to
extract the slug had been unsuccessful.  He left his
favourite Haussas&mdash;his 'black boys'&mdash;with every manifestation
of regret, at Cape Coast Castle.  Nor was the regret
only on his side, for we learn from one of his brother
officers that 'they looked up to him as a father, and would
willingly have followed him through any danger, even to
death itself.'

</p>

<p>
For his conspicuous bravery in the various engagements
in Ashanti, Sir Garnet Wolseley's despatches brought
Wauchope under the favourable notice of the Government,
and he was awarded the Ashanti medal and clasp.
On the return of the troops, they were received with the
utmost enthusiasm, commanders and men being fêted and
thanked, both at Cape Coast Castle and in England, for
their brilliant services.  The expedition entered
Portsmouth in March 1874, with loud demonstrations of
welcome, the Black Watch especially coming in for a large
share of popular attention.
</p>

<p>
Sir Garnet Wolseley had in London and elsewhere a
repetition of the extraordinary reception he and his
followers had experienced at Cape Coast Castle on their
triumphal return from Kumasi.
</p>

<p>
A civic banquet was given in April by the Lord Mayor
of London in the Egyptian Hall, at which nearly three
hundred guests sat down, including nearly all the officers
of the expedition.  Among those present were the Prince
of Wales, Prince Arthur, the Duke of Cambridge, and the
Duke of Teck, besides a number of members of the
Cabinet.  But although the bulk of the honours naturally
fell to Sir Garnet Wolseley and the senior officers of the
expedition, and Wauchope's name scarcely appears in
these public demonstrations, his friends in Scotland had
their eye upon the young lieutenant who had in a few
short months carved out for himself a distinguished reputation,
and had added to the laurels of the house of Niddrie.
The people of Portobello specially determined to show
their appreciation of his gallant services by a public
banquet, and though at first the natural modesty of the
young soldier shrank from such a recognition of his
services, after some persuasion he consented.  The
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P47"></a>47}</span>
banquet took place on the 12th June in the Town Hall.
There was a large gathering of the principal inhabitants.
Provost Wood presided, and was supported by, among
others, Sir James Gardiner Baird, Lord Ventry, and a
number of county gentry.
</p>

<p>
In proposing the toast of the evening, Provost Wood
took occasion to say:&mdash;'We are met to do honour to a
soldier who volunteered to serve on the staff of General
Wolseley in the recent war.  At that time it was thought
that British troops would not be required, but that the
friendly natives, commanded and disciplined by British
officers, would be able to cope with the savage Ashantis.
Lieutenant Wauchope, on his arrival at the Gold Coast,
was appointed one of the officers of the Haussas&mdash;a body
of natives who proved themselves superior in courage and
endurance to any of our African allies.  Commanded and
led by British officers&mdash;the chief being the gallant Lord
Gifford&mdash;these troops did much valuable service.  They
formed the van of our advancing army, and were frequently
engaged in the most severe and wild fighting.  Our guest,
in his ardour to see active service, had voluntarily separated
himself from his own regiment.  Yet he was destined to
share with them the dangers and glory of the war.  The
War Office, finding that the Ashantis were more formidable
than was at first expected, and that our native allies
were less to be relied upon, resolved to send out British
troops.  This meeting must feel proud, as an assemblage
of Scotsmen, that the 42nd Royal Highlanders was one of
the chosen regiments, and our guest must have felt gratified
when he found he had an opportunity of fighting beside
his own regiment at Amoaful; and at that place, while
leading on his Haussas, our gallant guest was wounded.
He did not, however, fall to the rear, but continued to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P48"></a>48}</span>
push forward, and, along with the glorious 42nd, he
entered the now famous city of Kumasi.  I need
scarcely recall the events of the campaign&mdash;how a very
small British army, with little assistance from native allies,
in the course of a few weeks beat and shattered the
enormous Ashanti forces, and compelled the hitherto
unconquered Ashantis to sue for peace, and give freedom
and security to the country round.  It has always been
the pride and the pleasure of the people of this country to
do honour to those who have fought and bled for their
country's cause, especially so when that cause is associated,
as it was in this instance, with the spread of civilisation
and the prevention and prohibition of slavery and cruelty.
The newspaper reports showed us that the Lothians had
gallant representatives at the Ashanti war, and the people
of Portobello felt proud to see the old and honoured
name of Wauchope prominently noticed.  We also felt a
desire to give expression to the sympathy and respect we
entertain for the house of Niddrie by a public demonstration
in honour of a young scion of that house, who has
proved that he has within him a dauntless spirit worthy of
his ancient lineage.  We desire this evening to congratulate
our guest, that a kind Providence has guarded his life,
and protected him through the imminent risks of a
pestilential climate and the dangers of a wild war; and
we hope yet to see Lieutenant Wauchope rise to that high
position in the service which his talents and abilities so
eminently qualify him to fill.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Banquet at Portobello
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Wauchope's reply was characteristic of the
man.  He was not quite so much at his ease, or felt he was
in his proper place, as if he had been at the head of his
Haussas.  'He thanked the Provost for the too flattering
words in which he had referred to his services.  He had
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P49"></a>49}</span>
not deserved such great honour at their hands.  His
services as rendered to the State were poor and
insignificant&mdash;very much so indeed.  But he felt himself standing
on firmer ground when he remembered that he was an
officer in the 42nd Royal Highlanders.  He recognised
in the entertainment a desire to mark their appreciation
of the conduct of the regiment to which he had the
honour to belong.  He had no hesitation in saying that
the 42nd deserved well of its country, and he thought that
it had added honour to its history.
</p>

<p>
'They were all well aware that the Ashantis had
invaded our allies' country, and had perpetrated many
horrible cruelties.  Our representative on the coast sent
remonstrances and threats, but these were all in vain
until backed by picked battalions.  Two hundred marines
were first sent out.  They landed at a most unhealthy
season, and most of them died.  Sir Garnet Wolseley then
arrived on the scene, accompanied by British officers, and
the result was that the Ashantis were driven back beyond
the river Prah, and within fifteen miles of Kumasi.  On
the 4th February, King Koffee gave instructions to his
bodyguard that any man who ran away would have his
head cut off.  But even King Koffee himself had to run
before the British bullets.  He did not think that the
lives that were lost, or the money that was spent, were
given in vain, because it would show those barbarous
nations that the glory of old England was not to be
trampled upon with impunity&mdash;that if people would
invade our territory and commit murders and crime, the
retribution would be terrible.  The British lion took a long
time to rise.  He was a grand old animal in his way; but
when he did rise, the vengeance would be speedy.  He
believed that the King of Ashanti bitterly regretted the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P50"></a>50}</span>
day that he first invaded the British Protectorate.'  He
thanked the company for the high honour they had done
him, and concluded with a few jocular remarks as to his
connection with the town and district.  He could assure
them, he said, that if fortune should smile on him, and if
on a future occasion he should return from some campaign
as a successful soldier, he should be disappointed
if he was not entertained by them in a similar manner.
He was proud of the district&mdash;of the county which
gave him birth.  He had often said to himself that
he would spend the latter days of his life in Portobello.
It might be that yet he would take the position of
a town councillor of the Burgh.  He had no doubt he
would make a most excellent civil magistrate, and be a
terror to evil-doers!  In afterwards replying to the toast
of the House of Niddrie, Lieutenant Wauchope referred
to the long connection it had with the district, and
'expressed the hope that as it had never brought dishonour
upon its name, it would never do so in the future.  So
far as in him lay, he would always try to sustain its
honour.'
</p>

<p>
It is perhaps not wise to attach too much importance
to after-dinner speeches, but there is a ring of sincerity
of purpose in these last words, which in the light of after
events gives them an importance they might not otherwise
have.  Wauchope lived up to his ideal standard of a
chivalrous knight, and nobly upheld the honour of his
name.  What Chaucer five hundred years ago wrote of
his imaginary knight, we to-day may say of our real
one:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'He nevere yit no vileinye ne sayde<br />
  In al his lyf, unto no maner wight,<br />
  He was a verray perfight gentil knight.'<br />

</p>

<p>
Wauchope's father was unfortunately unable to be present
on so auspicious an occasion on account of the state of his
health, but he was much gratified by this public recognition
of his son's services.  The latter, still in indifferent
health, with the slug-wounds in his chest giving him no
little trouble, had, however, a long period of rest, and was
much of the time at Niddrie.  His attention to his father
was very marked while at home&mdash;father and son being
frequently seen arm in arm walking through the grounds.

<p class="intro">
DEATH OF WAUCHOPE'S FATHER&mdash;ORDERED TO
MALTA&mdash;REMINISCENCES&mdash;RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS&mdash;CYPRUS&mdash;APPOINTMENT
AS CIVIL COMMISSIONER OF PAPHO&mdash;REMINISCENCES&mdash;SIR
ROBERT BIDDULPH&mdash;THE
SULTAN'S CLAIMS.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In November 1874 Wauchope had the misfortune to lose
his father, for whom, especially since the death of his
much-loved mother in the summer of 1858, he had the
closest affection, never permitting any opportunity to pass
without visiting the paternal roof.  Though Mr. Andrew
Wauchope of Niddrie was only fifty-six when he died, he
had for some years been very much of an invalid, and was
latterly unable to take any active part in public business.
He spent much of his time in and about his house and
grounds, taking a considerable interest in their improvement;
but outside he was well known for his efforts to
improve the position of those dependent upon him, and
for his quiet but consistent Christian character.
</p>

<p>
He attended for several years before his death the Free
Church at Portobello, then under the ministry of the
Rev. Robert Henderson Ireland.  There was no more regular
attender of the church than Mr. Wauchope, who was
generally accompanied by one of his daughters, and by
his son Andrew when he happened to be at home, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P53"></a>53}</span>
to the last the friendship between Mr. Wauchope and his
minister was of the most cordial and kindly nature.  We
believe he often expressed his sense of the benefit he
derived from sitting under Mr. Ireland's ministry.
</p>

<p>
On Mr. Wauchope's death Lieutenant Wauchope's
elder brother, William John Wauchope, then a Major in
the Enniskilling Dragoons, succeeded to the estates, and
in some measure this change altered his relationship to
the old home.  It could not now be the same to him as
formerly, though he was on the most friendly terms with
his brother, and not unfrequently spent some of his time
at Niddrie and Yetholm.
</p>

<p>
There is little doubt that his father's death, coupled with
his own precarious state of health, brought to his mind a
deeper conviction of the seriousness of life, and led to his
forming more pronounced views of religious truth.  But
Lieutenant Wauchope, having creditably won his spurs
and fought and bled in his country's service, was not the
man to rest upon his laurels.  He was ready, notwithstanding
former wounds, for further service when the occasion
might arise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Ordered to Malta
</span>
</p>

<p>
In November 1875 he again joined his regiment at
Malta, where it had been stationed for nearly a year.
His arrival among his old comrades was the occasion
of a cordial welcome at the Floriana barracks, and he
at once threw himself with spirit into the whole work
and drill of the regiment, taking a lively interest in the
welfare of the men and also of their wives and children.
A brother officer who was then also a subaltern, and had
joined the regiment at Malta a few months later, says:
'Wauchope was the "Father of the Subalterns" or senior
Lieutenant, and right well he "fathered" newly joined
youngsters, always ready to help them in any way&mdash;lending
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P54"></a>54}</span>
them ponies to ride and play polo on.  I was always,' he
continues, 'associated with him on the mess committee,
and served under him, and what struck one most about
him was the thoroughness with which he tackled whatever
was on hand.'
</p>

<p>
As regards the rank and file, he was a very brother to
many of them, as the following from one of the
colour-sergeants will show:&mdash;'Lieutenant Wauchope was always
a favourite with the men, and in Malta he took a deep
interest in them and did much for them, always manifesting
a kindly sympathy towards any who were married without
leave, or who happened to be involved in any trouble
which entailed a deduction from their pay.  On pay-day,
while the sergeant was paying the men, Wauchope would
often sit at the table looking on, and note any who got
only a few coppers on account of stoppage for support of
wife and family, or for other reasons.  He would quietly
tell them to wait a little till the company was all paid.
Then he would speak to each separately, giving them a
word of sympathy or admonition, along with a piece of
money, expressing the hope as he dismissed them that
they would try to do better in the future.  This was so
unusual as between officers and men that it had a
wonderful effect upon them.'  Even in their recreations and
amusements he showed an interest, and encouraged them
in every possible way.  'He kept a small yacht while at
Malta, and he was in the habit of inviting the sergeants to
an afternoon's enjoyment in cruising about the harbour for
an hour or two.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Life in Malta
</span>
</p>

<p>
With him, care for his men was his first thought; and
in commanding the G company of the 42nd in Floriana
barracks, another of his sergeants observes 'that even in
the hot summer afternoons, when the men were lying
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P55"></a>55}</span>
down in their beds, he used regularly to sit on the barrack-room
table lecturing them on minor tactics, often, I fear,
more to his own satisfaction than to their edification!'
</p>

<p>
Of this period of Wauchope's life we have a most
interesting sketch from one who had ample opportunities of
seeing his conduct, and forming a judgment upon the
motives and disposition of heart and mind which governed
his actions.  Dr. Wisely, who has for many years been
army chaplain at Malta to the Presbyterian soldiers
stationed there, formed a close and intimate friendship
with the young lieutenant on his arrival in the island.  He
saw much of him, and their acquaintance was renewed on
several occasions when Wauchope happened afterwards to
be there.  His opinion is therefore of some value.  'It is,'
says he, 'almost a quarter of a century since I became
acquainted with the late General Wauchope.  He was then
about thirty years of age; and although he had been in the
Black Watch for twelve years or more, and had also for a
considerable period been adjutant of the regiment, he was
still only a subaltern, and it seemed quite uncertain when
he would get his company.  Promotion in the 42nd was
at that time very slow, and I asked him whether he had
ever thought of changing into some other regiment, where
he might have a better chance.  His answer was a very
emphatic "No."  He wished to remain in the old corps
and take what came.
</p>

<p>
'Wauchope held some special appointment at home, and
his regiment had been in Malta for several months before
he joined them after the Ashanti war.  He had been
severely wounded in that war.  A leaden slug, fired by one
of the savages hidden among the branches of trees, entered
his breast, and it was a marvel he was not killed on the
spot.  He told me he bled like an ox.  His account of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P56"></a>56}</span>
how the blood at last stopped was somewhat curious.  His
old colonel, Sir John M'Leod, came to see him after he
was wounded, and on leaving he presented him with a
copy of the Book of Psalms.  Wauchope said that he
began wondering whether "old Jack," as he familiarly
called his commanding officer, whom he greatly venerated,
was in the habit of carrying about copies of the Psalms in
his pocket to give to officers when dangerously wounded,
and it struck him in such a ludicrous light that, after the
good colonel was out of sight, he burst into such a fit
of laughing that he could not stop&mdash;and that, he said
stopped the bleeding!  Sir John and Wauchope had a
great respect for each other.  Wauchope looked up to Sir
John with admiration bordering on awe.  The colonel
regarded his lieutenant as a model officer.  He told me
that Wauchope's character commanded universal respect,
and that his high moral tone and the thoroughness with
which he discharged all his duties gave him an influence
which was invaluable.
</p>

<p>
'On his arrival in Malta he was appointed musketry
Instructor at Pembroke Camp.  The men's shooting did
not come up to the standard which it was thought it ought
to reach; and one day Sir John said to me: "Wauchope
is making himself perfectly ill with his anxiety about it.
If he would only be anxious twenty-three hours out of the
twenty-four I would not mind so much, but he is anxious
all the twenty-four hours of the day!"
</p>

<p>
'At that time, however, Wauchope was anxious not
only about his professional duties, but he was concerned
about himself, for he knew that his life was a most
precarious one, scarcely worth a day's purchase.  The slug
which pierced his chest had not been extracted.  It kept
moving about, and at any moment might cause death.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P57"></a>57}</span>
This he knew full well.  He consulted the best surgeons
in the island, but they were unable to do anything.  It
was not, I believe, till about a year afterwards that the
slug was at last extracted by an Edinburgh surgeon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The drawn sword
</span>
</p>

<p>
'During this period of Wauchope's stay in Malta, when
there was, as it were, this drawn sword hanging over his
head, although he maintained a quiet exterior, he felt that
there was but a step between him and death.  I saw a
great deal of him then.  He had brought a letter of
introduction to me from his law-agent in Edinburgh, my old
friend the late Mr. Colin Mackenzie, W.S., and from the
first he honoured me with his confidence.  He spoke
freely of the possibility, not to say the probability, that
his time on earth might be short, but he showed no craven
fear.  He said he wished to know as much as he could
about the world into which he might soon be going&mdash;that
"undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller
returns."  I have seldom met a man further removed from
fanaticism, and at the same time so full of reverence.
From his earliest days he seems to have feared God.  He
had not, however, escaped from the doubts and difficulties
raised by the sceptical spirit of the age.  He shrank from
taking a leap in the dark.  He wanted to be sure that
there was no mistake, and he took the best means of
becoming sure.  "If any man will do His will," Christ
says, "he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of
God."  This is what Wauchope did.  He put the desire
to do God's will into every duty which fell to him.  He
followed on to know the Lord, and he came to know the
truth of the Gospel, not only as a truth of faith, but a
truth of personal experience.'
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Wauchope was home on furlough more than
once during the period of the 42nd regiment's stay in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P58"></a>58}</span>
Malta, extending to nearly four years, and it was on one of
these visits to Edinburgh he was operated upon
successfully, as mentioned by Dr. Wisely.
</p>

<p>
Though still only a lieutenant, he was appointed to the
command of E company in July 1878, while in Malta.
With a wider range of duties and greater responsibilities,
this appointment gave him much satisfaction, and he set
himself to the task of making E company <i>the</i> company of
the regiment, sparing neither time nor money to advance
its efficiency, and at the same time to add to the comfort
and pleasure of his men.  To be one of Wauchope's
company was considered a high privilege.  Two months
afterwards&mdash;in September&mdash;he received his full commission as
captain.  In addition to the yacht in which he would give
them occasional cruises, we are told by one of his men
that 'the company had a good boating-crew, and at a cost
of about £20 he had the best boat built for them that
Malta could produce.  On one occasion, when they had
some races, Captain Wauchope steered them in a match
with the 101st regiment, but not to victory.  Wauchope's
boat, named "The Black Watch," was beaten, but he was
the first to declare that the race was lost owing entirely to
his bad steering.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Occupation of Malta
</span>
</p>

<p>
The occupation of the island of Cyprus by Great Britain
in 1878 gave Wauchope a splendid opportunity for the
exercise of his talents, not only as a military man, but in
the capacity of a civil administrator and judge.  The
island was taken over from the Turks in July of that year.
Their government of it for centuries had been a curse to
the people and a curse on the land, and it had lapsed into
one of the forgotten spots of God's earth.  The advent of
British rule proved the beginning of a new era for both its
Greek and Turkish population.  Endowed with a healthy
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P59"></a>59}</span>
climate and a fertile soil, Cyprus&mdash;once so fruitful and
prosperous&mdash;may yet rank as one of the most flourishing
dependencies of the Crown.  It is full of romance, for its
lovely scenery and relics of the past well entitle it to be
called 'an Enchanted Island.'  With mediæval traditions
of its occupation by the Crusaders, and with its still older
classical reminiscences of the heathen worship of Aphrodite,
supplanted by the early conversion of its people to
Christianity through the visit of St. Paul, St. Mark, and
Barnabas, not to speak of its repeated conquest by
Phoenicians, Egyptians, Greeks, Venetians, and Turks,
there is no more interesting island to be found in the
Mediterranean.

Captain WAUCHOPE at the Age of 30.
</p>

<p>
In July 1878 a regiment of Scottish Highlanders was
sent to occupy this fair island of the Orient in name of the
Queen.  The Black Watch from Malta, in the transport
<i>Himalaya</i>, landed at Larnaka, and were distributed at various
points for garrison duty, under the direction of General
Sir Garnet Wolseley, as High Commissioner.  Wolseley,
having divided the island into districts, deputed the civil
administration of these to a number of the most skilled
of the military officers of the regiment.  To Lieutenant
Wauchope, then thirty-two years of age, was given, with
the title of captain, the charge of the town and district of
Papho&mdash;the ancient Paphos, where the Apostles' journey
through the island closed, and where Elymas the sorcerer
was struck blind for a time.  As assistant-commissioner
Wauchope was well supported by Lieutenant A. G. Duff,
a young officer of his company, who furnishes us with some
particulars of their duties and difficulties there.  The post
was anything but a sinecure.  He had the superintendence
of the revenue under Sir Robert Biddulph, then Financial
Commissioner of the island.  In this important office he set
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P60"></a>60}</span>
himself with all the earnestness of his nature to the
correction of abuses, the suppression of crime, and the
establishment of law and order, out of which only can freedom
and security be attained.  We have it on the authority of
Mr. F. H. Parker, the District Judge of Limasol, that 'not
only was he a most efficient governor, but in those days,
when Ottoman judges sat in the Daavi (District) Court,
he presided as a just and capable judge.  Though more
than twenty years have elapsed since then, the inhabitants,'
he says, 'irrespective of creed or nationality, still look
back on his civil administration with admiration and deep
respect.  Even to this day his decisions in disputed land
or water rights are relied on as <i>res judicata</i>, and he
invariably decided these after minute and personal local
inquiries.'  During his two years' service on the
island&mdash;from 17th June 1878 till July 1880&mdash;Wauchope acquitted
himself with much judgment and discretion, and the
honours thrust upon him were worthily achieved as they
were gratefully given.  But while Captain Wauchope's
administration in Cyprus was marked with justice, it was
sometimes of a kind that did not always give satisfaction.
His punishment, for instance, of heinous crimes was
considered by the natives to be of such severity that a
complaint was lodged with the Colonial Office against
some sentences where he had ordered the delinquents to
be flogged.  On inquiry being made of him by the
Colonial Office as to what he had to say in the matter, his
reply was that 'flogging was the only thing for them, as
they richly deserved more than the punishment they had
got, and he thought it was better for them than hanging'!

Sergeant M'Gaw's funeral
</span>
</p>

<p>
His duties did not end in military, or administrative, or
judicial service, for sometimes he had even to act as
chaplain in cases of emergency, as the following instance
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P61"></a>61}</span>
will show.  A day or two after they landed, Sergeant M'Gaw
of the 42nd&mdash;who had gallantly won the Victoria Cross at
Amoaful&mdash;took ill under the excessive heat and died.  The
regimental chaplain was not present, but Wauchope
followed the funeral with his company, and at the grave,
stepping forward as the body was about to be committed
to the dust, feelingly addressed his men in a few
appropriate words of exhortation, and concluded, to the
surprise and gratification of all, with an earnest extempore
prayer.  Tears, we are told by one who witnessed the
occurrence, were in the eyes of many a stalwart soldier
that day, and the incident made a deep impression at the
time and was never forgotten by them.  A sequel to
Sergeant M'Gaw's funeral may here be mentioned as
another instance of Wauchope's thoughtful care.  Some
time afterwards it was discovered that the Cypriote
farmer on whose land the sergeant was buried, had removed
the little wooden head-mark, and not unnaturally ploughed
up the land and destroyed all trace of the grave.  The
Government was asked to take action, but declined to
interfere.  So Wauchope and some others went on a
moonlight night, and after taking measurements from a
certain tree, discovered the grave, dug up the remains,
removed them to Kyrenia, and placed them in what is
now known as the Black Watch cemetery.  A pure white
marble sarcophagus now covers Sergeant M'Gaw's grave.
</p>

<p>
After the long reign of Turkish misrule it will be easily
understood that Commissioner Wauchope and his colleague
Lieutenant Duff did not all at once find things easy.
On the contrary, they found it very hard work.  The
rascality of the natives was as idyllic as innocence.
Murder and theft were so common that they were scarcely
considered culpable, and this in what has been called an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P62"></a>62}</span>
'enchanted island,' full of every beauty to satisfy the eye,
and every fruit to satisfy the taste.  Even ten years after
the occupation by the British, and notwithstanding all our
efforts to restore order and justice, W. H. Mallock,
describing his visit to Cyprus in 1888, says that 'he found
there more crime in proportion to the population than in
any other known country in the world.'  In Nicosia the
prisons were full of persons, male and female, confined
for murder, theft, etc.  'In the country districts,' he says,
'the cause of murders has generally some connection with
sheep-stealing or disputes about boundaries and water
rights, or matters equally simple.  In the towns the
Turkish murders nearly always originate in some ordinary
fit of sombre but sudden passion, and the Greek murders
in some half-drunken brawl.  Curiously enough, a number
of these last take place at weddings.  Wine has flowed;
quarrelling has arisen out of laughter; knives have flashed,
and in a second or two one knife has been red with blood.
Yet amid so much crime there exists among this degraded
people a whimsical simplicity almost justifying a smile.'  One
instance, as given by Mr. Mallock, will suffice to
illustrate this.  One of three men implicated in a murder
fled to the hut of a shepherd, and begged to be kept there
in hiding.  The shepherd, who had only a slight acquaintance
with the man, asked why he wished to be hidden.
On this the murderer, more like a child than a man,
explained everything in the most naïve manner possible.
The shepherd looked grave.  He said that this was a
serious matter, and that under the circumstances his
protection would have to be paid for.  The murderer
replied that the booty had not yet been divided; 'I have
no money,' he said, 'but save me and I will steal a sheep
for you!'

<span class="sidenote">
A Cyprian judge
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was among criminals such as these, and a population
with the vaguest possible notions of morality, that Wauchope
had to deal out justice.  How did he accomplish his task?
His friend and colleague, now Major Duff, tells us: 'His
administration of justice was a marvel, and astonished
both Turks and Greeks.  He would frequently sit a whole
day in the Konak or court-house, dispensing even-handed
justice.  All the evidence had to be taken through an
interpreter, involving much delay, and frequently he sat
in this way under high fever.  I have sometimes taken
his temperature to find it at 105°, but he bore all physical
pain without a murmur, and no complaint ever passed his
lips.'  Papho was considered the most lawless district in
the island; and the administration of justice, in both civil
and criminal cases, in the hands of Captain Wauchope
and Lieutenant Duff, with the aid of an interpreter,
involved painstaking discretion of no ordinary kind.  'The
Cadi&mdash;a Turkish judge&mdash;had a seat on the bench along
with them, and his opinion was always taken, though not
always followed.  One incident comes to my memory
relating to an execution.  We had passed sentence upon
a murderer, but were in a difficulty about the gallows, and
did not know what to do for want of a suitable rope,
but fortunately H.M.S. <i>Raleigh</i> unexpectedly put in an
appearance in the bay, and the bluejackets readily came
to our aid in rigging up a makeshift gallows.  The
ceremony, however, was not marked with complete success,
as, at the first effort, the rope broke; but death had
supervened, so that it was of no consequence, as the
operation did not require to be repeated.  There must
have been some flaw in the rope, as it had been previously
tried with a very heavy man's weight.  We never had any
difficulty in the administration of justice.  Wauchope's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P64"></a>64}</span>
impartial and thoroughly sound sense of judgment as
between man and man, always stood him well with clients
and malefactors.'
</p>

<p>
One case came before him which in this connection is
worthy of being recorded.  A Turk of infamous character,
who had been guilty of horrible crimes, but had escaped
punishment under the Turkish rule, was brought before
Commissioner Wauchope on a charge of murder.  The
murder was clearly proved, but doubts were entertained
whether the Commissioner would sentence a Mohammedan
to be hanged.  No such instance had ever been known in
the island before.  Wauchope did not flinch.  He
pronounced the sentence, and the murderer was publicly
executed.  The Commissioner took the precaution,
however, of having a company of his Royal Highlanders on
the ground to see that there should be no disturbance or
any attempt at rescue, and all passed off peacefully.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Commissioner at Papho
</span>
</p>

<p>
Besides the judicial functions of the Commissioner of
Papho, there were the fiscal duties of Government.  Taxes
had to be collected, and these, with the relative duties of
finance and the management of the post office, were
entirely under the personal control of Wauchope and his
colleague.  The latter service alone must have involved
considerable labour.  Besides this, they had at Papho one
company of the 42nd, camped some little distance out of
the town, but near enough to be readily available when
required.  So busy were they kept with these varied
onerous duties, that Wauchope and his friend, frequently
working at high pressure, had few opportunities for
recreation.  But notwithstanding the pressing requirements
of the moment, and the somewhat circumscribed social
aspect of the place, they were on the best of terms
with some of the leading native gentry: the Greek bishop
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P65"></a>65}</span>
was particularly friendly, and they often dined with him
at his palace.  A worthy old fellow he appears to have
been, who could enjoy a good dinner with a prime bottle
of Cyprus wine.  In recognition of his great kindness
to them Major Duff mentions that they 'gave him in
return such a banquet on St. Andrew's night as seemed to
gladden his soul.'
</p>

<p>
Of amusements, or anything in the way of English
sports, there were few or none, even had time permitted.
Still, they would not have been British if they had not
introduced among the natives some sports from the old
country.  They accordingly started pony races for the
zaptiehs or police of the district.  'Our chief difficulty,'
says Major Duff, 'was to get the Turks and Greeks to run
together in the same coach, and for this difficult task
Wauchope was eminently qualified, as, in addition to all
his many sterling attributes, must be added that of being a
student of human nature, without which he never would
have been the leader of men he unquestionably was.'
</p>

<p>
So much did Captain Wauchope accomplish during his
term of office at Papho, that Dr. Wisely informs us 'the
inhabitants looked on him as an angel from heaven&mdash;and
well they might, when they contrasted his righteous rule
with the wretched rule of the Turkish officials who had
tyrannised over them.  Yet Wauchope was by no means
an easy-going ruler.  He investigated with the greatest
patience every case that was brought before him, and
spared himself no pains to get at the truth.  This made
such an impression upon the Turks, as well as upon the
Greek-speaking community, that all classes alike respected
him, and when the time came for the Commissioner to
retire from office, there was a universal desire expressed
that he might be retained.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P66"></a>66}</span>
</p>

<p>
We have been favoured with similar testimony from Sir
Robert Biddulph, sometime High Commissioner of Cyprus,
lately Governor of Gibraltar, who informs us that 'in
carrying out his duties Captain Wauchope showed much
administrative ability, as well as great tact and judgment
in dealing with the inhabitants.  This enabled him to steer
a clear course through the political agitation which broke
out in Cyprus early in 1879, and which had many
adherents in Papho.  When Sir Garnet Wolseley left the
island at short notice in May 1879 in order to command
the troops in Natal and Zululand, his departure, coinciding
with the attacks made in Parliament on the Cyprus
administration, caused several of the civil commissioners
to send in their resignations.'  Colonel Biddulph, who
had been sent from Cyprus to Constantinople in March
1879 to negotiate with the Porte concerning the 'tribute,'
was in June following instructed by the Home Government
to return and assume the government of the island
as High Commissioner.  On his arrival he was met by
Captain Wauchope, who had come with several of the
other commissioners to wish him good-bye before leaving
the island.  Sir Robert at once realised the gravity of
the situation.  'I told them,' says he, 'that I could
not consent to their leaving all together at this crisis,
and Wauchope willingly consented to remain for, at all
events, some months longer.  In September I went home
for two months on private affairs, and Wauchope then
went home with me, having resigned his appointment with
my consent.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Sultan's claims
</span>
</p>

<p>
In the interval, certain questions as to personal claims
by the Sultan to property in Cyprus were presented to the
British Government, and it was decided to appoint a
qualified British delegate to investigate these claims on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P67"></a>67}</span>
the spot.  On the recommendation of Sir Robert Biddulph,
Lord Salisbury appointed Captain Wauchope for this
somewhat difficult duty, and he and Sir Robert returned
to Cyprus together in November of the same year.  In his
official capacity Wauchope explored the whole of Cyprus,
making full inquiries wherever he went as to the properties
alleged to belong to the Sultan, and gathering much
information as to the condition of the people in the rural
districts, and the state of agriculture generally.
</p>

<p>
'The investigation of the Sultan's claims,' says Sir
Robert Biddulph, 'occupied several months, during which
time Captain Wauchope again displayed great tact and
judgment in this very delicate matter, and maintained at
the same time very friendly relations with the Turkish
officer who was sent by the Sultan to support his claims.
This was the more remarkable, because every one of the
Sultan's claims was rejected.'
</p>

<p>
The Government recognised the thoroughness with
which Captain Wauchope had accomplished his task, by
conferring upon him, immediately on his return home in
August 1880, the Order of St. Michael and St. George.

CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p class="intro">
WAR IN SOUTH AFRICA&mdash;ARABI PASHA'S REBELLION IN
EGYPT&mdash;TEL-EL-KEBIR&mdash;MARRIAGE&mdash;LIFE IN CAIRO.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Shortly after Captain Wauchope's return home from
Cyprus another opportunity for foreign service presented
itself in South Africa, and he lost no time in offering
himself to the War Office.  He was accepted for staff duty,
and received a commission to go out at once.  So limited
was the time given him for preparation that he had not
even an opportunity to go to Aldershot, where his baggage
was lying, to make up his kit, but he telegraphed from
London to the quartermaster of the regiment&mdash;Captain
Forbes&mdash;to throw him in a small kit into a bullock-trunk
and forward it to Southampton at once, as he was off to
South Africa next day.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Transvaal
</span>
</p>

<p>
The country had drifted almost unconsciously into a
trouble which has since cost so much in loss of life and
treasure.  The South African Republic, or the Transvaal, was
founded some sixty or seventy years ago by Boer farmers
from Cape Colony, who, being dissatisfied with British rule
and its interference with them and their peculiar notions
as to slavery, sought to establish an independent state for
themselves where they might without hindrance carry out
their ideas as they pleased.  They, in fact, sought liberty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P69"></a>69}</span>
to make the natives their slaves.  Conflicts were, of course,
the natural outcome of their attempts to acquire the land
beyond the Vaal; but notwithstanding this, the new settlers
in 1840 were so far established in possession, and their
numbers had so much increased, that they formed themselves
into a Republic for mutual protection.  At that time
the possibilities of the future importance of this part of
South Africa, or indeed of our colonies there, were not
sufficiently realised by either our Government or our people
at home.  Neither the Transvaal Republic nor the Boers
seemed to be any concern of ours.  It was left to a few
Scotch missionaries such as Moffat, Livingstone, Stewart,
and Mackenzie to make these known, and to endeavour
to educate and civilise the degraded natives in the science
of social life and in the truths of Christianity.  In this
effort they met from the first the virulent opposition of
the Boer settlers, who neither wanted the natives to be
educated nor to be Christianised.
</p>

<p>
Acts of oppression naturally brought their own retribution.
The natives rose against their oppressors; feuds,
murders, and thefts were acts of daily occurrence, until at
last the infant Republic became so involved in native wars
and internal troubles, that with a view to restore peace and
order and to prevent anarchy and bankruptcy from spreading
into Cape Colony, the British Government was constrained
to interfere.  In this intervention many of the
Boers cordially acquiesced, and welcomed the protection
of our troops, the more so that the financial difficulties of
their independent action were in a measure cleared away.
On the other hand there was a strong party among them
who, in spite of mismanagement and debt, thought they
could carry on a free Republican Government.  The
security of the British colonies was, however, of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P70"></a>70}</span>
paramount importance, and it was deemed advisable in their
interest as well as in the interest of the Transvaal Boers
themselves that the Transvaal should have the benefit of
British protection.  Accordingly its annexation to the
British Crown was in 1877 proclaimed by Sir Theophilus
Shepstone, followed by the appointment of Sir W. Owen
Lanyon as British Administrator.  This necessary step
by no means pleased the Boer faction who had attempted
to rule, and they did not cease to agitate for the
restoration of the old order of things, bad as these were.  For
a time English money and English enterprise worked
wonders: markets were created for produce, and land rose
in value.
</p>

<p>
In December 1880, however, a majority of the Boers
took up arms against the British authority.  They
invested towns held by Imperial troops, and surprised a
detachment on the march.  The situation was becoming
critical.  The Government, which at the time was deeply
engrossed in other matters, did not sufficiently realise the
gravity of the situation, for although troops were at once
despatched to the assistance of those at the Cape, these
were insufficient, and arrived too late to be of service.
The Boers, ever on the alert, had seized the passes of the
Drakensberg Mountains, and had strongly fortified
themselves at Laing's Nek.  Here they were attacked by Sir
G. P. Colley, but without success.  He was defeated with
considerable loss, and shortly afterwards, attempting to
check the enemy at Majuba Hill with a small force of
six hundred men, he was again defeated with loss and
was himself killed in the action.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Boer Treaty of 1881
</span>
</p>

<p>
Immediately on receipt of this news Mr. Gladstone's
Government gave instructions for an armistice in order to
see if satisfactory terms could not be arranged for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P71"></a>71}</span>
restoration of peace.  After a month's negotiation a treaty
was made giving the Transvaal self-government in internal
matters, but reserving all rights connected with foreign
affairs, Great Britain to be recognised as the Suzerain,
including the right to move Imperial troops through the
country in time of war.
</p>

<p>
This restoration of independence to the Boers was viewed
both at home and in Cape Colony not only with grave
suspicion and distrust, but with high indignation; and so
strong was this feeling against the home Government that
in a great popular demonstration at Cape Town the effigy
of Mr. Gladstone, the Prime Minister, was publicly burned,
and the British lion was caricatured, while many English
residents in Pretoria and other towns left the country rather
than remain under the oligarchical government of the
Boers.  So ended this part of the Transvaal drama.
</p>

<p>
The action of the British Government was at the time
attributed to various motives.  By some it was considered
the magnanimous action of a strong power, willing to help
a weak but struggling state in its efforts at self-government;
by others it has been described as a pusillanimous
shrinking from a stern duty which it owed to its colonies
around the Transvaal.  President Brand declared the
treaty to be 'in his opinion the noblest act England has
ever done'; but the Boers themselves considered the
peace as the result of their own efforts and of Britain's fear
to prosecute the war.  The after results have been most
calamitous, and go to show the folly of not facing and
overcoming the beginnings of a corrupt system.
</p>

<p>
Captain Wauchope returned on the conclusion of peace
in the summer of 1881, having been only a few months
abroad, and without engaging in active service.  He was
chiefly employed on the line of communication as one of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P72"></a>72}</span>
the staff.  His return home was accompanied with anything
but feelings of respect for the Government which had
so ingloriously stopped short in their work&mdash;a feeling very
generally shared by the officers and men.  Some years
afterwards, when alluding to this episode in his life at a
meeting in Edinburgh, he said of it:&mdash;'I was in the
Transvaal during those terrible times in 1881 when we suffered
the terrible disgrace from which all our after-troubles there
arose.  It was the vacillation and weakness and change of
policy that caused all the trouble then.'
</p>

<p>
But while in one part of Africa a temporary peace had
been patched up, in another part of that great continent,
and that the most ancient, events were in the beginning of
1882 hastening to a rupture which was destined to open
up a fresh field for the active military genius of young
Wauchope.  Egypt, the land of the Pharaohs, and in some
respects the cradle of European culture, which had long
been oppressed by Turkish tyranny, was showing signs of
vitality, and was recognised as still a country capable of
great resources, and having considerable commercial
importance.  The opening of the Suez Canal had much to
do with this; and Britain having a large stake in the Canal
as a means of communication with her Eastern possessions,
was naturally interested in the well-being of the country
through which it passed.  Nominally a viceroy of the
Sultan of Turkey, the Khedive of Egypt ruled despotically,
and did little for the people he ruled.  Discontent was
general; and to screen themselves, those in authority
endeavoured to create a feeling of antipathy against the
Europeans residing and trading in Egypt.  A party of
military adventurers, headed by Arabi Pasha, and secretly
abetted by the Sultan of Turkey, had seized the reins of
government, and endeavoured, with the aid of the army,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P73"></a>73}</span>
to drive all Europeans out of Egypt, and secure the control
of foreign traffic through the Suez Canal to their own
advantage.  Arabi commenced the erection of forts at
Alexandria, to command the harbour.  This and other war-like
preparations were made in defiance, it was said, of the
authority of the Khedive, who was merely a puppet in
Arabi's hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Bombardment of Alexandria
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 11th June 1882 a large body of Arabs made a
murderous attack on the European residents in Alexandria,
and so serious was the matter considered that a
week or two after, the Ambassadors of the Great Powers
met in conference at Constantinople to take the crisis
under review.  As no redress was forthcoming, Admiral
Sir Beauchamp Seymour, commander of the British fleet
in Egyptian waters, having ascertained that work on the
new fortifications at Alexandria was being continued,
notwithstanding promises made that all such operations would
be suspended, sent to Arabi Pasha, who was nominally
the Egyptian minister of war, an ultimatum that unless the
work ceased immediately the fleet would open fire upon
the forts.  The reply was a denial that any such work was
being carried on.  Three days afterwards the Admiral
discovered that his ultimatum was treated with contempt,
and that guns bearing upon the harbour had been mounted
since the date of his message.  He at once prepared a
proclamation calling upon the Egyptian authorities to
surrender the fortifications within twelve hours, otherwise
they would be demolished by the fleet.  On the 11th July
the bombardment commenced, and nearly the whole of
the fortifications were soon laid in ruins.  Next day
hostilities were resumed, but, on a flag of truce being hoisted,
the Admiral ordered firing to cease.  On the morning of
the 13th it was found that, under cover of the flag of truce,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P74"></a>74}</span>
the Egyptian troops, headed by Arabi Pasha, had evacuated
Alexandria, leaving it to be pillaged and fired by a riotous
mob of Arabs, who massacred a large number of Europeans.
To protect life, and save the place from total destruction,
Admiral Seymour landed a force of seamen and marines,
who kept the city in order until the arrival of British troops
a few days afterwards.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the following fortnight a force of about
16,000 occupied Alexandria, Ramleh, and the delta of the
Nile, under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley.  Meantime
Arabi Pasha had occupied Cairo, which was strongly
fortified, while he had formidable entrenched camps some
miles south of Ramleh, and also at Port Said and Ismailia
on the Suez Canal, and at Kassassin and Tel-el-Kebir, on
the sweet-water canal route between Ismailia and Cairo.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the whole business the authority of the
Khedive was not only ignored, but remonstrances from
foreign powers were of no effect.  Arabi was determined
to make himself ruler of Egypt, and to assert his position
by force of arms.  His formal dismissal as Minister of War,
on 22nd July, was the last weak attempt by the Khedive
to maintain his sovereign authority.  But Arabi paid no
attention to it, and continued his warlike preparations.
His position at Kafr-dawar was strategically a strong one,
for he was entrenched there at a point where the isthmus,
running inland between Lake Medieh and Lake Mareotis,
is only about four miles broad.  He thus commanded
both the Mahmoudieh Canal and the railway to Cairo,
which ran past his camp.  Arabi's intention was to hold
his own at this position till the annual rise of the Nile was
at its fullest in August, when he counted upon being able
to flood the country, and seriously impede hostile
operations against him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P75"></a>75}</span>
</p>

<p>
The rising had now assumed all the character of an
organised rebellion, and was a standing menace to British
commerce passing through the Suez Canal; and as the
crisis came to be more clearly realised in this country,
further relays of troops were despatched.  In the
subsequent operations against Arabi the Black Watch took a
prominent part.  After its return from Cyprus and
Gibraltar in 1879, the regiment was brigaded for a time at
Aldershot.  It was then located partly at Maryhill barracks,
near Glasgow, and at Edinburgh Castle, under the
command of Colonel R. K. Bayly.  Captain Wauchope served
at Maryhill from May 1881 till August 1882.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The 42nd leaving Edinburgh
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the outbreak of hostilities in Egypt the regiment,
which was then about 800 strong, received orders to
embark for the East.  The Maryhill contingent, in which
he commanded the E Company, left by train for Edinburgh
on the 4th August 1882, and arrived in the capital
amidst much enthusiasm.  After two days in Edinburgh
Castle, the whole regiment was entrained for London on
the 6th August, their send-off from the city being one of
the most extraordinary ever witnessed.  Wauchope himself,
ten years afterwards, at a meeting of the old members
of the Black Watch in Glasgow, when he had become
Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, said 'he would
never forget the scene.'  'He had of late,' he said, 'seen
great excitement in the political world, he had seen political
leaders received in Edinburgh (referring to Mr. Gladstone
and the Midlothian election of 1892), and no doubt at
times there had been a pretty brave show, but the people's
heart never went out to these leaders as it went out to
the 42nd when they were leaving Edinburgh Castle
for active service in Egypt in 1882.  It seemed to him as
if every man and woman in Edinburgh was out to see
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P76"></a>76}</span>
them off.  He would never forget that scene of enthusiasm
and farewell, and he felt convinced that it affected the
whole regiment, more than the eye could see or words
could express.  On the lips of many a brave man before
that campaign was over, the last words had been "Scotland
for ever," and he had no doubt their last thoughts were of
their homes and native country.'
</p>

<p>
Having embarked at Gravesend in the transport <i>Nepaul</i>,
Wauchope, with his regiment, landed at Alexandria on the
20th August, and proceeded to Ramleh, where they formed
a part of the Highland Brigade under General Sir Archibald
Alison.  Here Wauchope very soon found his field of
action in more than one engagement, and had one or two
hairbreadth escapes.  On one occasion a body of the rebels
held a portion of the city, from which they were to be
dislodged.  Wauchope got the order to clear the streets.
Coming to a house, from every window of which rifles were
pointed, he halted his men, but only for a moment.  Sword
in hand, the captain rushed in, followed by his men.  A
rifle was pointed full at him, and but for the presence of
mind of one of his followers, it would have ended his
career.  Dashing in front of his officer, the soldier threw
up the rebel's rifle just as he fired, the bullet passing
through Wauchope's helmet.

Tel-el-Kebir
</span>
</p>

<p>
The occupation of the Canal and the various ports upon
its banks were important steps in Sir Garnet Wolseley's
endeavour to secure Zagazig, some forty-five miles from
Ismailia, the key to the railway system of Egypt.  Arabi had
also realised its importance, and in order to retain it at all
hazards and to prevent the British advance in that direction,
had strongly fortified himself at Tel-el-Kebir, about
fifteen miles eastward.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th August, Port Said, Kantara, Ismailia, and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P77"></a>77}</span>
the Suez Canal were taken possession of by the British.
A few days after, a determined stand was made by the
Egyptian army, about 10,000 strong, a few miles from
Ismailia, but they were utterly defeated by Sir Garnet
Wolseley, who was now reinforced by the Highland
Brigade.
</p>

<p>
This was followed up by a renewed attack on the British
position at Kassassin Lock on the Ismailia Canal three
days later, when the Egyptians were again repulsed with
great loss.
</p>

<p>
On the evening of the 12th September, the British army at
Kassassin Lock struck camp.  It had been well reinforced,
and counted 15,000 men in cavalry, infantry, and artillery,
and was now in a position to attack Arabi in his stronghold
at Tel-el-Kebir.  On the verge of a broad, dreary desert,
with lines of entrenchments and redoubts well mounted
with guns, and held by a large force, no better position, it
is said, could have been chosen for offering resistance to
any army approaching the Delta, or the capital of Egypt,
from the Suez Canal.
</p>

<p>
After an all-night march, Sir Garnet Wolseley found
himself within striking distance of the enemy's trenches
before the first streaks of dawn appeared on the eastern sky.
The Egyptians were taken by surprise, but the alarm once
given, they sprang to their feet to face the attack; and
immediately, along the whole front of their line of defence,
was poured upon our troops a fierce artillery and rifle fire,
which, however, was so ill directed that it did no great
harm.  With the utmost coolness, the British were formed
for the assault.  The Highland Brigade in the centre, with
bayonets fixed, was supported by cavalry on both flanks
With a loud cheer the Highlanders stormed the entrenchments,
driving everything before them.  The struggle was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P78"></a>78}</span>
short but decisive, not more than twenty minutes elapsing
between the first onset on the trenches and the capture of
the main or inner fortress.  The odds were as two to
one&mdash;26,000 Egyptians to 13,000 British&mdash;but the zeal and
soldierly qualities of our men, with the confidence they had
in their leaders, proved the mettle of which our military are
made.  Where all did well, it seems invidious to distinguish.
But of this fine force&mdash;perhaps the finest ever seen
in Egypt&mdash;it was generally admitted that to the Highland
Brigade and the Royal Irish Rifles special honour was
due.  This important engagement, in which forty guns
were captured, 2000 Egyptians fell, and 3000 were taken
prisoners, opened the way to Cairo.
</p>

<p>
Through all the campaign, Captain Wauchope, with the
E Company of the 42nd, had bravely borne his share
of the toil and dangers of the situation.  At Tel-el-Kebir,
he was among the first to enter the enemy's trenches sword
in hand.  The encounter was a fierce one while it lasted,
and it was a marvel how he escaped injury in such a
mêlée.  But though the impetuosity of the charge bore
down all before it, when the fight was over, it was found
that no less than 200 of his men had fallen.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
After Tel-el-Kebir
</span>
</p>

<p>
Wauchope's first care was to see that the wounded were
attended to, for his interest in his men was ever uppermost
in his mind.  He liked to treat them as brothers as well as
subordinates, sharing with them the roughest work and the
greatest dangers; and now particularly, when many of them
were bruised and bleeding, he had all a woman's sympathy,
and did his best to alleviate their sufferings.  He went
carefully over the ground after the battle, searching out
from among the dead such of his men who might be alive,
relieving some with a draught of water from his bottle, and
seeing that they were removed to shelter, where they could
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P79"></a>79}</span>
be surgically attended to; in some cases, tenderly helping to
carry them himself off the field.  Such scenes always filled
him with sadness, as they did the heart of Wellington, who
was wont to say: 'Take my word for it, if you had seen
but one day of war, you would pray to Almighty God that
you might never see such a thing again.'  The horrors of
war make most brave natures shudder.
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the capture of Arabi's camp at Tel-el-Kebir,
at the next halting-stage in the army's progress to
Cairo, the 42nd was marched into the square of a cavalry
barracks to wait for a train being made to enable them to
follow the retreating enemy to Zagazig&mdash;an important
railway junction on the way.  They were in very rough
quarters, but were glad to get any sort of shelter from
the scorching sun.  One of the staff-sergeants, wearied out
and oppressed with heat, stumbled into a room which,
unknown to him, happened to be occupied by Captain
Wauchope and his subordinate officer, Lieutenant Duff.
'As I attempted to withdraw&mdash;for I had entered not
knowing they were there'&mdash;said the sergeant, describing the
occurrence, 'Captain Wauchope at once called out in a
kindly voice, "Come in, Pinkney, come in and sit down,
you have as much right to be here as we have."'
</p>

<p>
But though this was so, Pinkney, who was not one of his
men, did not fare so well on another occasion when his
presence stood in the way of the convenience of the men of
his company, Captain Wauchope having then no hesitation
in leaving him to shift for himself.  We give the story in the
sergeant's own words:&mdash;'Shortly after this, we were marched
down to the railway and literally packed into trucks.  I
being a staff-sergeant, and in a sense "nobody's child,"
crawled into one marked E.  It was Wauchope's, and as
all his men could not find room, I was ignominiously
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P80"></a>80}</span>
ordered out by the same gallant gentleman!  We were
very good friends, but as I did not belong to his company,
he could not allow me to interfere with their comfort!'
</p>

<p>
Sergeant Pinkney also relates an incident of the same
day illustrating Wauchope's thoughts on the inhumanity of
war.  'We were all sitting together on the mud floor of the
room where we were sheltering, discussing the events of
the morning.  "Andy," as we all loved to call our captain,
had not, for a wonder, been wounded, but a Remington
bullet through the scabbard of his sword had bent it nearly
double, so that he could not return the weapon.  Another
bullet through his helmet had disarranged the pugaree
and heckle, of which he was so proud.  He drew my
attention as armourer to the condition of his scabbard,
and I took it into my hand and broke it across my
knee, so that he could sheath his sword, though some
eight inches of the blood-stained blade were exposed.
While I was next adjusting his pugaree, he suddenly
exclaimed, "I say, Duff, what brutes we men are."  We were
silent for a minute, and then seeing our surprised look, as
we stopped our work, he continued, "Do you know, I felt
this morning just as if I was on the moors, and for a while
I was quite as anxious to make a good bag; man, Duff, we
are terrible brutes, after all!"'

<p>
The same day Wauchope's regiment proceeded to within
a few miles of Zagazig, reaching that place in the morning
of the 14th September.  Here they seized the railway stock,
and went on to Belbeis, an important junction on the edge
of the desert.  There they remained under the utmost
discomfort, without tents and without equipage, until the 23rd
September, when they moved forward to Ghezireh, near to
Cairo, and were again quartered with the Highland Brigade,
under Lieut.-General Sir E. Hamley.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P81"></a>81}</span>
</p>

<p>
The subsequent occupation of Cairo, the arrest and
banishment of Arabi Pasha, and the restoration of the
Khedive under British protection, are matters of history.
The war was closed, but still much required to be done to
restore order and peace, and so the expeditionary force
became an army of occupation.
</p>

<p>
Captain Wauchope, after a few weeks' encampment at
Ghezireh, on the west bank of the Nile, was moved with
his regiment into Kass-el-Nil barracks, where they were to
be quartered for the winter.  A time of peace succeeded a
time of sharp fighting.  But whether fighting or at peace,
Wauchope gave himself no rest.  His military duties
might be heavy enough, but his self-imposed exertions
in looking after the wounded and the sick were varied
by efforts to find amusement and recreation for those
who were well.
</p>

<p>
For his services in this campaign, Captain Wauchope
received the medal with clasp, and the Khedive's Star, as
the public recognition of the British and Egyptian Governments.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Return to Scotland
</span>
</p>

<p>
His stay in Egypt was unexpectedly interrupted by the
serious illness of his elder brother, Major William Wauchope,
which eventually resulted in his death on the 28th November
1882.  Returning home a few weeks before that sad event,
he was fortunately enabled to look after the settlement of
family affairs and the future management of the estates.
</p>

<p>
The death of his brother without issue made a considerable
change in his position, and when he arrived at
Niddrie early in December, he was welcomed as the new
laird with every expression of goodwill.  Though he had
been little about the old place for years, the tenants
and servants had warm recollections of 'Andy' as a good,
kind, genial soul, and they all hoped that he might now
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P82"></a>82}</span>
return to occupy the ancestral home, and settle down
among 'his ain folk.'
</p>

<p>
As a pledge that such a consummation might be looked
for in the near future, and taking advantage of his casual
visit home, he was married on the 9th of December to Miss
Elythea Ruth Erskine, second daughter of Sir Thomas
Erskine of Cambo, Fife, to whom he had for some time
been engaged.
</p>

<p>
The wedding had been arranged to be celebrated at
Cambo in a quiet way, as our informant said, 'without
any fuss'; but though this was so, Captain Wauchope
found to some extent the adage verified, that 'the course
of true love never did run smooth.'  In arranging for his
marriage in the stormy month of December, he did not at
all events lay his account with the elements.  These did
their best to frustrate the happy event.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Marriage
</span>
</p>

<p>
Cambo is situated two or three miles distant from Fife
Ness, the extreme eastern point of the county of Fife.  It
is now easily accessible by the railway skirting the northern
shore of the Firth of Forth, connecting Thornton Junction
and St. Andrews, by way of Anstruther and Crail.  But at
that time the railway was not completed further than
Anstruther on the one side and St. Andrews on the other,
and Cambo was about eight or nine miles from either
place.  Starting from Edinburgh on the morning of the
day fixed for the wedding, Captain Wauchope should
easily have arrived at Cambo in the forenoon, but a
protracted snowstorm of several days had completely blocked
railways and roads.  Thinking he would be more likely to
get a conveyance to carry him to his destination if he went
by St. Andrews, he took that instead of the route to
Anstruther; but on arriving at that ancient city, he was
chagrined to find that the roads were so completely
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P83"></a>83}</span>
blocked with snow that no one would venture the journey
for him.  Taking his luggage to the Royal Hotel, he tried
all his persuasive powers with Mr. Davidson, the genial host,
to get a carriage, or even a dogcart, ready for him without
delay.  But the storm still raged, and he was told that
the roads were quite impassable either for driving or
riding, and he would require to remain where he was for
the night.  'But,' said the would-be and now desperate
Benedict, 'I <i>must</i> get to Cambo, as I am to be married
to-night.'  The hotelkeeper assured him that in the
circumstances it was impossible, but promised to do the best
he could for him the next morning if the weather moderated.
At length, convinced that nothing more could be done, the
disappointed swain was obliged to bow to the inevitable,
and eat his solitary dinner with what resignation he could
command.  It was a severe trial of patience, but there
was nothing else for it, and so he remained overnight in
the friendly shelter of the 'Royal,' in the hope that he
might get release the following day.  Sir Thomas Erskine,
meanwhile, expecting the bridegroom to come by way of
Anstruther, where the roads happened not to be so badly
blocked, had sent a carriage with the young bride to meet
him there.  But no Wauchope appeared, and the young
lady had to return home without tidings of her lover.
The disappointment of all may be better imagined than
described, and the wedding was of course postponed <i>sine
die</i>.  The following morning the storm had somewhat
abated, but the snow-drift still lay deep on the roads,
making them quite impassable for wheeled vehicles.
Davidson, true to his word, however, gave him the best
horse in his stable, repacked his luggage in carpet-bags
slung across the back of another, and with a groom in
attendance Wauchope courageously faced the elements to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P84"></a>84}</span>
meet his bride.  It was a toilsome business, and not
without danger.  At Browhill, some two miles from
St. Andrews, the block was so deep that they were compelled
to make a detour, or 'a flank movement,' as he afterwards
described it, across the fields, but in doing so they came
to grief.  The horse which Wauchope rode stumbled and
fell through the accumulated snow into a deep ditch,
where it was well-nigh smothered, and the combined efforts
of Wauchope and groom utterly failed to extricate the poor
animal.  At length assistance was procured, a number of
farm servants from the neighbourhood giving willing help,
and after a good deal of exertion it was at length got out,
while the groom, wiping the perspiration from his brow,
declared, 'This is terrible work, captain; it's worse than
Egypt yet!'  The remainder of the nine-mile journey was
completed in safety.  Love had triumphed.  A warm
welcome greeted the belated bridegroom at Cambo, and
though 'one day after date,' the marriage cheque was duly
honoured!
</p>

<p>
The hopes of his friends at home that he might now
give up active service, and become a local county magnate,
were not, however, to be realised.  Captain Wauchope,
accompanied by his young wife, returned to Egypt a few
weeks after their marriage, to take up his military duties
with the Black Watch; and there, in the quaint old Oriental
city of Cairo, they spent together the first and, alas, the
last year of their married life.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Life in Cairo
</span>
</p>

<p>
Perhaps no other town under the sun has so many
different characteristics as Cairo, and certainly few places
afford such strong contrasts.  It is at one and the same
time an official capital, a city of immemorial antiquity, a
garrison town, a health resort, an Oriental centre, and the
Paris of the Dark Continent.  Half the hidden charm of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P85"></a>85}</span>
Cairo and its surroundings, it has been said, consists of
the strongly incongruous sights that meet an observant
eye: the modern woman leaning on her bicycle, and steadfastly
looking at the unchanging eyes of the Sphinx, or a
laughing party of officers and Americans in the shadow of
the Great Pyramid, or among the tombs of the caliphs,
its Oriental bazaar crowded with British soldiers and
sailors: an old world and a new.  Chief among the attractions
of Cairo is its climate, combining almost continuous
sunshine, comparative warmth, and an air of pure and
tonic qualities.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wauchope resided during these months at the
Grand Hotel, within comparatively easy distance of
Kass-el-Nil barracks, where the captain's daily duties lay, and
amid new surroundings found much to interest her, while
she materially helped him in his work among the men of
his regiment.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, though the climate as a rule is excellent
during the greater part of the year, sanitary arrangements
and modes of living were not then, whatever they may
be now, such as to prevent the evils to which most
Eastern cities are subject.  Cholera, one of the scourges
of the East, broke out in Cairo among the Copts in the
summer of 1883, and, spreading among the better classes
of society, even found its way among the British soldiers.
Their removal from Cairo for a time was considered
absolutely necessary; but before this could be effected,
the Black Watch had suffered considerably from the
epidemic.  As soon as possible, however, cholera-camps
were formed at Suez in July, where the greater part of the
regiment remained till the beginning of September.
During this time Captain Wauchope, with the rank of
brigade-major, was left in charge of the Kass-el-Nil
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P86"></a>86}</span>
barracks with a small detachment; and surrounded as they
were with an epidemic which was then cutting down
hundreds of poor natives, without adequate means of
relieving the distress, he was much moved by what he saw, and
did his utmost to help.  His first care was of course for
the soldiers under his command.  They did not altogether
escape, and in a number of cases that occurred he was
assiduous in his attention.  Regardless of danger to
himself, he would go back and forward between the hospital
and the barracks, giving all the comfort and material
assistance that were required.
</p>

<p>
But it was not merely in his co-operation with medical
men and nurses that Wauchope's aid was given: he was
a valued co-worker with the chaplain, assisting him in
visiting and addressing meetings.  The Rev. John Mactaggart,
who was then acting with the 42nd in Egypt, says,
'He was always ready to aid me, and willingly responded
to any reasonable request for money on behalf of the men,
such as in helping to defray expenses incurred in holding
social, temperance, or religious meetings.'  'I remember,'
he continues, 'in the summer of 1883, the cholera, after
raging for weeks among the native population, attacked
the British troops.  As a precautionary measure, these
were dispersed and located at considerable distances from
Cairo, the Black Watch being sent to the brackish lake
near Suez.  Captain Wauchope's sympathetic nature was
deeply stirred by the many sad sights around him in Cairo,
where he remained through it all with a small company of
the regiment.  Two of his men were stricken down, one
immediately after the other, with the fell disease, and not
being able myself to attend to them at once, he was full of
anxiety about them, and could not rest till he got me to see
them at the barracks, quite heedless of danger to himself.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P87"></a>87}</span>
</p>

<p>
To many a poor fellow he was throughout all this trying
time a friend indeed, counselling, helping, and encouraging
wherever he had the opportunity.
</p>

<p>
At the evening voluntary meetings in the barracks, too,
he frequently took a part with the chaplain in the religious
services.  His consistent manly conduct and the quiet,
unobtrusive profession of his faith at this time, not only
endeared him to many, but gave him a wonderful influence
for good which it is difficult fully to estimate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A Cairo mob
</span>
</p>

<p>
Every one has his own characteristic: Wauchope's was
consideration for his men.  'Years ago,' says a friend,
'I was in the street in Cairo with him, when there
approached us a bareheaded Highlander, running for his
life, and pursued by a crowd of Arabs armed with sticks.
Captain Wauchope halted the fugitive, turned about,
ordered him to fall in in front, and thus we marched
to the barracks, the mob howling behind.  The Captain
handed the man over to the sergeant of the guard, and
notified his intention of giving evidence in the orderly-room
next morning.  A few days later I was to meet the
Captain at the club and take a drive with him.  On
arrival there, I found a note directing me to come to the
hospital.  The orderly led me to a ward, but I could see
no Captain.  I interviewed the orderly again, and he told
me to go to the far end and I would find him.  There, on
the bed of his colour-sergeant, retailing the day's news, sat
the officer commanding his company.  On my approach,
with a cheery adieu and a promise to come back again on
the morrow, Wauchope rose and went for his drive.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Wauchope was sent home in the summer of 1883, as it
was not considered safe for her to remain in Cairo, and she was
joined by the Captain in November.  They took up their residence
at Niddrie for six weeks, afterwards going to Cambo on
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P88"></a>88}</span>
a visit.  Towards the end of January they proceeded to
London, where Mrs. Wauchope gave birth to twins&mdash;both
boys.  The joy of this event was, however, speedily
followed a few days after, on the 3rd February, by the
death of Mrs. Wauchope.
</p>

<p>
It was a terrible blow to the Captain, and though he
bowed submissively to the will of God, he none the less
felt his loss keenly, and for a time was inconsolable.
</p>

<p>
The children were taken to Cambo, where, under the
charge of Lady Erskine, they were tenderly nursed and
cared for, while Wauchope himself sought in renewed
activity to forget, if possible, the misery of his
bereavement.  When they were three years old both the children
unfortunately caught scarlet fever.  One, a specially
promising child, died, and the other was left a hopeless
invalid.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Though peace had been restored to Egypt by our arms,
and security of life and property was being established
and upheld by the presence in the country of the army
of occupation, new troubles were brewing in the upper
waters of the Nile.  General Gordon, as the representative
of the Khedive in the far-away capital of the Soudan
province of Upper Egypt, was endeavouring to maintain law
and order in the midst of turbulent tribes of wild Arabs.
Disaffection and rebellion against Egyptian authority broke
out on all sides, and the first murmurings were heard of
a new power emerging out of the African darkness,
threatening to overwhelm and sweep before its fanatical
sword every evidence of modern civilisation.  The rise of
the Mahdi as a religious and political force was one of the
most extraordinary movements of modern times, and can
only find a parallel in that of Mohammed himself, whose
follower the Mahdi or Prophet of God professed to be.
With a success at first truly marvellous, he managed so to
impress his claims to sanctity upon the Arab tribes of the
Soudan, that they flocked to his standard in thousands.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P90"></a>90}</span>
Cleverly seizing the occasion of discontent at excessive
taxation and the destruction of the slave trade, which,
under European influence, the Egyptian government had
attempted, the Mahdi el Muntazer raised the cry of
revolt, and openly proclaimed himself, by the grace of
God and his Prophet, master of the country.  His
fanatical pretensions, carrying the weight of religious
sanctity, bore down all opposition for a time.  General
Gordon was sent to stem the torrent, and reaching
Khartoum on the 18th of February 1884, bravely held it
against overwhelming numbers for eleven months.
</p>

<p>
The British authorities who were responsible for
Gordon's appointment, but who were unfortunately not
equally alive to the danger of his position, resolved at
length upon an expedition for his relief, to proceed by
the Red Sea to the port of Suakim to operate in the
Eastern Soudan, between the sea and the River Nile, where
a number of Egyptian garrisons were being threatened
by the rebellious tribes under Osman Digna.  British
troops in and about Cairo, Alexandria, and other stations
were at once despatched under the command of Sir
Gerald Graham to quell the disturbance.  Wauchope,
who had received the appointment from Lord Wolseley
of Assistant-Adjutant and Quartermaster-General to the
expedition, left England on short notice, and, accompanied
by Sir Redvers Buller, arrived in the Red Sea towards
the end of February, in time to take his share in active
operations against the enemy, who were strongly fortified
and in possession of Tokar.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Battle of El-Teb
</span>
</p>

<p>
The expeditionary force was landed at Trinkitat, a port
on the Red Sea, some miles south of Suakim, and Tokar
being inland, a long and fatiguing march had to be
undertaken to reach it.  When half-way they encountered
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P91"></a>91}</span>
the Arabs in a strongly entrenched position in the desert
at the wells of El-Teb, and here, on the 29th February, a
fierce conflict took place, the Arabs fighting with great
determination.  The Black Watch and the York and
Lancashire Regiment took a prominent part in the battle,
and suffered severely.  To the former fell the main attack
on the right and centre of the enemy's position, where
their chief strength lay, protected as it was by skilfully
constructed rifle-pits, defended by resolute men, ready to
die rather than yield.
</p>

<p>
Captain Wauchope escaped with his life as by a miracle.
Being on horseback, charging the enemy's guns, he was a
prominent figure in the fight, and was unfortunately struck
down by a musket-shot, which entered the lower part of
his body.  He was only saved from instant death by the
friendly intervention of his binoculars, which were hanging
by his side, the bullet striking the glass and smashing it to
pieces.  He was carried off the field, and at once attended
to.  But the wound was of such a serious nature that little
hope was entertained of his recovery.  The battle over, and
the Arabs completely routed, the British force proceeded on
their way to Tokar without further opposition, and relieved
the small garrison there.  Wauchope and the other wounded
men were taken back to Trinkitat and put on board ship
for Suez.
</p>

<p>
When sufficiently recovered to be able to be removed
from the hospital, he rejoined the Black Watch at Cairo
in the month of April.  The binoculars which, it may be
said, saved his life at El-Teb have been carefully preserved,
and may now be seen in their shattered condition among
other relics and war trophies in Niddrie House.
</p>

<p>
For his gallant conduct at the battle of El-Teb,
Wauchope received a favourable mention in General
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P92"></a>92}</span>
Graham's despatches, which procured for him the medal
and two clasps, and what was perhaps of more importance,
the rank of Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel.
</p>

<p>
He suffered long and severely from the wound he had
received, but he was much benefited in health by a visit
which he made to his old friend Sir Robert Biddulph
at Mount Troodos in Cyprus during the summer of that
year.
</p>

<p>
In the autumn came further rumours from the Soudan of
the rising power of the Mahdi, and the danger with which
General Gordon was threatened of being overwhelmed in
the capture of Khartoum.  It was now resolved that
active and immediate steps should be taken in order if
possible to relieve him, notwithstanding that the distance
was great, and the road perilous, and to a great extent
unknown.  The Black Watch was called upon once more
to undertake this difficult task, and officers and men
responded to the call with enthusiastic delight.  The
regiment at Cairo numbered about 700, and at an
inspection there by General Sir Garnet Wolseley on 16th
September, he complimented Colonel Bayly and the
officers and men under him on the highly efficient state
in which they then were, and the pride with which the
people of England had followed them in the gallant
upholding of 'the honour of their splendid and historic
regiment.'  'I do not think,' he continued, 'there will be
much fighting in the coming campaign, but there will be
very hard work, and I shall want you to show that you
can work hard as well as fight.  If there is any fighting to
be done, I know that I have only to call on the Black
Watch, and you will behave as you have always done.'
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
Relief of Khartoum
</span>
</p>

<p>
The sequel proved this to be a true forecast.  The expedition
was beset with difficulties from first to last, and the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P93"></a>93}</span>
labour involved was enormous&mdash;the pity of it being, that
after all, the result was not commensurate with the cost,
and was altogether disappointing.  With Cairo as their
starting-point and Khartoum as their goal, the intervening
space of over fifteen hundred miles, with its sandy plains,
its waste howling wilderness, held by hostile tribes of Arabs,
had to be covered by our troops.  This was a work of no
ordinary kind, and involved not only skill in planning, but
persevering toil in execution, which tried to the utmost the
stuff our soldiers are made of.  The Black Watch, led by such
men as Colonels Green, Bayly, Kidston, Coveny, Eden,
and Wauchope were a host in themselves, and abundantly
justified the confidence reposed in them by the
commander-in-chief.  The expedition started on 5th October
by rail to Assouan, where they hoped immediately to
begin the ascent of the Nile by steamers and barges.
Unfortunately, one or two cases of smallpox here broke
out among the men of the 42nd, and the regiment was
compelled to go into quarantine for four weeks.  They
pitched their camp within a palm-grove close to Assouan
on the banks of the Nile, and the tedium of enforced
idleness was relieved by preparation for the arduous task
before them.  Colonel Wauchope energetically exerted
himself during these weeks, and in the off hours of drill
encouraged the men not only in out-door sports of all
kinds, but was active in getting up theatrical and other
entertainments for their amusement.  In this way the
time passed pleasantly until the regiment was released
from quarantine on 12th November, when the real
forward movement for the relief of General Gordon
commenced, so far as the Black Watch was concerned.
Embarking at Philae, famed for its ancient island temple,
in steamers and barges, the voyage of two hundred and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P94"></a>94}</span>
fifty miles was safely accomplished to Wady Halfa, after
which, avoiding the second cataract of the Nile, the journey
to Sarras was made overland.  Here there was considerable
detention waiting the arrival of a large flotilla of 800
whale boats&mdash;which had been commissioned from England
by Lord Wolseley for transporting the troops up the river.
Regiment after regiment were here embarked to fight the
cataracts, the rapids, and the shallows of the mysterious
river whose source had for ages been hidden in the dark
recesses of the African Continent.  Surely no stranger
or more gigantic armed force ever floated on its waters
either before or since the days of Egypt's ancient
greatness!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Nile Expedition
</span>
</p>

<p>
As it was, the British soldier&mdash;'capable of going
anywhere and doing anything'&mdash;had for the nonce to convert
himself into a boatman; and that he had much to learn
in this capacity may be gathered from one of the jokes
familiar to the expeditionary force, to the effect that
one day a man at the helm, on receiving the order 'put
your helm down,' immediately proceeded to place the
tiller in the bottom of the boat, and innocently awaited
further orders!  The boats provided were about thirty
feet long, seven feet beam, and with a draught of two and
a half feet.  As the boats were destined each to be
self-supporting, they had, when finally loaded, supplies of
ammunition, ordnance, and commissariat stores for
fourteen men for one hundred days.  But it was not
unusual for the boats to be carrying practically one
hundred and twenty days' rations and other stores, and
reserve ammunition for fourteen men, with a crew of
eight men in each boat.  Great caution and skill were
necessary in an expedition so full of novelty and danger,
and if accidents did happen, it is no matter of surprise,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P95"></a>95}</span>
considering that it was through an almost entirely
unknown country and among hostile tribes their course
lay.  With a falling river, too, the dangers and difficulties
were increased, for boats were frequently striking sunken
rocks, and springing leaks, which necessitated their being
hauled up on the river bank, unloaded of their tons of
stores, and then repaired by the soldiers themselves, for
there was no one else to do it.  In some places there was
barely room for a loaded camel to pass between the
perpendicular rocks; in others, where the path was wider, the
rocks had been prepared for defence by loop-holed stone
sconces.  There was no order or regularity in the
formation of the rocks.  'They seemed,' said one eye-witness,
'to have been upheaved in a mass, in some great volcanic
convulsion, and to have fallen one upon another in every
direction.'
</p>

<p>
Throughout this remarkable voyage Colonel Wauchope's
early naval experience stood him in good stead.  Having
the command of the E company of the Black Watch he
had charge of sixteen boats, with ten men in each.  He
divided the company into two parts so that each section
might have free scope, and collisions be avoided; and,
thanks to his ever watchful eye and naval skill, the
soldiers in the boats speedily became expert sailors.
From the Rev. Mr. Mactaggart, who accompanied the
expedition at the special desire of Colonel Wauchope,
and was in his company, we give the following narrative.
'According to Lord Wolseley's orders, each boat was to
have been provided with one or two Canadian steersmen,
but in some way it was found impossible to get this, and
after two days' delay we succeeded in getting away with
one Canadian in every second boat&mdash;eight men instead of
thirty-two; much therefore depended on Wauchope
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P96"></a>96}</span>
himself.  Before starting on several occasions, I remember
he had all of us assembled on the river-side, and gave
out minute instructions theoretically and practically how
to enter the boat, how to sit on the bench, how to handle
the oar, and how to splice a rope.  His instructions were
always much needed and most excellent.  Then as to
loading and unloading, he would demonstrate how this
could most easily be done, and with least danger.  He
was careful to emphasise his caution as to managing the
boats in the strong eddies and currents of the stream, and
above all to avoid racing or endeavouring to get ahead of
each other.  With a vein of humour in his voice, and yet
meant as a serious joke, he would say&mdash;"Mind you, my
men, no Derby racing!"  On one occasion, in pulling the
boats over a strong current, two boats' crews were necessary
to get one at a time over it, but through some hitch
one of these with its contents would have been irretrievably
lost but for his opportune energy and pluck.  The
men, exhausted with the heavy strain upon them, slackened
the rope, and in a moment the boat had turned and was
being carried back.  Wauchope at once seized the rope,
and held on to it tenaciously, though drawn in among the
rocks at the edge of the rapid, and had his hands very
much lacerated for his pains.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fighting the Cataracts
</span>
</p>

<p>
Many incidents&mdash;some amusing and some serious
enough&mdash;occurred in these daily battles with the river;
but Wauchope was ever in the thick of it if a difficulty
occurred; and while as commander he was prompt in
giving his orders, he was never above giving his men a
helping hand when needed.  'It was during our toilsome
ascent of the third and fourth cataracts,' says another
comrade of the expedition, 'a staff officer was detailed
in charge of different districts up the banks, whose duty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P97"></a>97}</span>
it was to guide and instruct the boats in their passage up
the rapids, or, as the men put it, "to worry and irritate the
troops."  On one occasion Colonel Wauchope's boat was
in trouble, and the staff officer was shouting any amount
of advice gratis from the bank.  Thinking apparently that
enough notice was not being taken of his instructions, he
called out, "You No. 2 boat there, do you know who I am?
I am Colonel Primrose of the Guards."  This immediately
drew the following answer from a wild-looking, red-headed,
and half-naked worker in the boat, "And do you know who
I am, sir?  I am Colonel Wauchope of the Black Watch,
so honours are easy!"'  Though otherwise kind to a
fault, in the matter of discipline he was firm as a rock
in adhering strictly to orders.  Indeed at this juncture he
was invaluable to the regiment, for he acted at the same
time both as president of the canteen and mess; and as
one of his brother officers informs us, 'it was only through
his continual forethought that we were able to obtain
supplies for our daily wants.'  'A favourite dinner on the
Nile,' says one of his men, 'which was looked upon as a
great luxury, was one pound of bacon per man, in place of
the usual tinned meat, as by dint of self-denial a bit of it
might be saved for breakfast next morning.  This was
served out by the captain, and great was the consternation
one day in the drum-major's boat when the cook fell
overboard with the boat's rations in his hand.  The man was
secured, but the bacon went to the crocodiles.  The
matter being reported to Colonel Wauchope, it was hoped
the rations might be replaced.  But not having seen the
accident, he was obdurate.  The ration had been issued
and could not be replaced, so the unfortunate boat's crew
worked hard all that day on biscuit and tea only.
Evening came, and tea was being made when word was passed
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P98"></a>98}</span>
along the bank that the drum-major was wanted by Colonel
Wauchope.  Hope sprang up that he had relented at the
eleventh hour; but no such luck.  To his honour be it
said, however, he divided his own pound of bacon with
the drum-major that night, and it was his all, for officers
and men fared alike at that time.'  Still they knew their
commander, and no grumble was heard.  Though he
might be strict, they all felt he had their interest at heart.
</p>

<p>
The rough work of fighting the cataracts was telling
sorely upon uniforms and shoes, some of the men being
actually in rags.  They had proceeded as far as Ambu-Kui,
and the necessity for having new boots was so pressing,
Wauchope set out two or three miles inland to where
there was a bazaar and bought for his men all the boots
and shoes he could get.  The old dervish from whom he
purchased them assured him with all seriousness of their
excellence, saying, 'Well now, oh ye faithful, if you buy
them you can go straight to Paradise'&mdash;a recommendation
of his goods which the colonel enjoyed immensely.
</p>

<span class="sidenote">
Battle of Kirbekan
</span>
</p>

<p>
Struggling on from day to day in their toilsome up-river
journey, one hope animated every breast, that the gallant
general holding his own with defection and treachery among
his native troops in Khartoum, and a fanatical horde of
Arabs under the Mahdi outside its walls, would be able to
hold out until the arrival of the British force on its way to
relieve him.  General Gordon was in a most critical position.
The enemy being numerous, and ever increasing, hemmed
him in on all sides, while famine was pressing him even
more seriously within.  It was a long road, and bravely
Lord Wolseley encouraged his troops to renewed exertions.
In the first week of January 1885 the leading companies
of the 42nd Highlanders arrived at Korti, and on the
13th January the headquarters rowed into Hamdab with
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P99"></a>99}</span>
fifty-four boats.  By the 20th the whole regiment was
once more together at Hamdab, and with the South
Staffordshire, the 2nd Battalion of the Duke of Cornwall's
Light Infantry, the 1st Battalion of the Gordon
Highlanders, one squadron of the 19th Hussars, an
Egyptian Camel Corps, and a section of the Engineers and
Bluejackets, formed the Nile River Column, under
Major-General Earle.  Making a further advance, the difficult
Edermih Cataract was surmounted on the 25th January,
and the Kab-el-Abd Cataract two days after.  But it was
only by the daring skill of the Canadian voyageurs and
the constant toil of the whole force that the boats were
got successfully over, for now the currents of the river
were getting more difficult to face.  At the fourth or Bird
Cataract they began to feel the enemy in stronger force,
and at Kirbekan, some seven miles further on, the ground
overlooking the Nile was found to be fortified with every
determination to resist the passage of the boats.  The
troops were accordingly formed for battle, and the British
line under General Earle advanced upon the entrenchments.
Finding it impossible, however, to dislodge the
Arabs by musketry fire alone, orders were given for the
Black Watch to carry the position by the bayonet.  The
regiment responded gallantly to the order.  The pipers
struck up, and with a cheer the Black Watch rushed
forward with a steadiness and valour that were irresistible,
and which called forth the enthusiastic admiration of the
general.  From the loop-holed walls of the enemy the
rifle puffs shot out continuously, but, undaunted by danger,
the 42nd scaled the rocks, and at the point of the bayonet
drove them from their shelter.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Bayly of the 42nd, who commanded the left-half
battalion, has favoured us with the following account
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P100"></a>100}</span>
of Wauchope's intrepid daring in this action.  'Kirbekan,'
he says, 'was one of the last fights at which I was present
with him.  He was in command of a company of my half
battalion in the attack on the Arabs' position, a high,
precipitous rocky range rising from the river's bank.  We
were fully engaged, when Wauchope, asking my leave,
descended the precipitous bank of the river, then in full
flood.  Returning in a few minutes, he said he could take
the company over the rocks, and with perhaps a little
wading he could turn the flank of the kopje held by the
enemy.  This he did, and rolled the enemy up to their
final stand, a roughly built stone shanty, where General
Earle (who was in command) and Colonel Coveny met
their deaths.  And here Wauchope himself was badly
wounded.'  Meanwhile the cavalry had captured the
enemy's camp, and the Staffordshire regiment had
gallantly stormed the last remaining ridge.  The battle
of Kirbekan was won on the 11th February.
</p>

<p>
Wauchope was assisted down from among the high
rocks by his friends Captain Stewart and Mr. Mactaggart,
the chaplain, and had his wound attended to by Dr. Harvey
and Dr. Flood.  They found his shoulder very much
shattered, and were of opinion that his arm would have to
be amputated.  He himself was apparently not conscious
that he was dangerously wounded, and endeavoured to
treat the matter lightly.  Having persuaded the doctors to
delay the operation till next day, we are told he seemed
after a little to be more concerned about the condition of
his brother officer, Lord Alexander Kennedy, who had
also been severely wounded in the action, than about
himself.  After further consultation, to the great relief of
Wauchope, it was determined to give him a chance of
saving his arm.  The wound was carefully and successfully
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P101"></a>101}</span>
dressed.  This disablement, however, reduced him
from the position of an active leader in the expedition to
that of a mere spectator.  He was quite laid aside for a
time, and compelled to remain in one of the boats floating
on the Nile&mdash;no pleasant experience for one of his active
temperament.
</p>

<p>
Still keeping Khartoum, with its noble defender, in
view, the expedition, though yet more than 450 miles
from their destination, pushed on with vigour.  Passing
Hebbath, the scene of poor Colonel Stewart's murder by
the chief of the Monassir tribe a few months before,
thence to El Kab, where the current is very swift, the
215 boats of the force arrived at Huella, not far from
Abu Ahmed, with its beautiful green sward on the banks
of the river.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Death of Gordon
</span>
</p>

<p>
This was destined to be the furthest point to which the
river expedition was to penetrate.  Relief had arrived too
late, for here the British force learned that the end had come
in Khartoum, and that all their labour had been in vain.
The city had been treacherously taken by the Mahdi, and
General Gordon had been killed on the 25th January, or
nearly a month before.
</p>

<p>
As the object of the expedition was said to be merely
for the relief of Gordon with his Egyptian garrison, and
the British Government had determined to abandon the
Soudan entirely, there was nothing left for Lord Wolseley
to do on the receipt of this sad intelligence but to retrace
his steps.  On the 13th February, Sir Redvers Buller, with
the Desert Column, which had reached Gubat, evacuated
that place; and, as the reason for the occupation of Berber
by the River Column had practically ceased, orders were
received commanding a halt.  Ten days afterwards the
flotilla commenced the return journey down the swift and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P102"></a>102}</span>
broken waters of the Nile.  It was an unfortunate end of
an undecided policy which delayed the relief of the noble
Gordon until it was too late.  Had the Government taken
up the matter earnestly some months earlier than they did,
Lord Wolseley's expedition would not only have saved
Gordon a tragic death and relieved Khartoum, but would
then have crushed the power of the Madhi for ever.  Thus
would have been accomplished in 1885 a piece of work
which, simply by being then neglected, had again to be
taken up thirteen years afterwards, but which was brought
then to a successful issue by the entire overthrow on 2nd
September 1898 of the Mahdi's successor by General Sir
Herbert Kitchener at Omdurman.
</p>

<p>
Wauchope all through this expedition had proved himself
an invaluable pioneer in the rough and arduous work
they had to encounter, and the many difficulties to be
overcome.  He was highly popular with all ranks from the
Commander-in-Chief to the youngest drummer, for he
looked upon every one as simply his fellow-workers, and
was ever ready to help any in trouble.  'Gifted,' as one
of his brother officers has said of him, 'with a singularly
attractive and lovable disposition, he made friends of
every one he met.  With the simplest of tastes himself,
and (after the deaths of his father and brother) with ample
means at his disposal, he used to help more particularly
those married with or without leave in the regiment, and
these cases I only heard of by accident.  He never spoke
of them himself.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A staunch Prespyterian
</span>
</p>

<p>
Nor was his interest in his men limited to merely secular
matters.  He was deeply impressed with the conviction
that, carrying as the soldier did his life in his hand, there
was no class of men who ought more to be prepared for
death.  And facing death, as he so often did himself, he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P103"></a>103}</span>
felt that the consolations of religion should be within the
soldier's reach when needed.  He was a staunch Presbyterian,
loyal to his national religion, and ever ready to give
the chaplain of his regiment his support and help.  When
the Nile Expedition had reached Korti it was resolved that
none but fighting men should go further, and some of the
chaplains were accordingly left behind as an unnecessary
impediment.  Just before starting, an officer of the staff
came to the chaplain of the Black Watch, who happened
at the time to be standing beside Colonel Wauchope, with
the order that he was not to proceed further.  The
chaplain replied that there was nothing for him to do at
Korti, if he were separated from the regiment; he urged
that he had been sent from Cairo with the Gordons and
the Black Watch, and that he would go with them where
duty called.  Wauchope at once said, 'Stick to that and
I will back you up.'  The chaplain without any further
demur was allowed to proceed, and he was the only
chaplain who got beyond the base to be in time to do
duty in action.  In this connection an instance of his
strict military discrimination may be mentioned.  A man
of his company came and complained to him that he had
been told off by the sergeant-major to remain at the base.
A certain number of men of each corps had been so
ordered, and naturally the best soldiers were not left
behind.  Wauchope replied to this man, 'You are a
soldier who is often drunk, often late for parade, often
absent, and we can't depend upon you.  We prefer to
take men we can trust.'  The man, very much crestfallen,
and evidently disappointed, said, 'Sir, if you will take me
to the front, I promise you I'll never be brought before an
officer again.'  Wauchope said, 'Very well, I'll take you
at your word, but if you don't keep it, I'll never do
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P104"></a>104}</span>
anything more for you.'  The man behaved perfectly well
during the campaign, and loyally kept his word.  'It may
be hoped,' says the friend from whom we have the story,
'that Wauchope's considerate action was the means of
pulling up a man who was on the downward course, and
the making of a good soldier out of a bad one.'
</p>

<p>
One may be sure that the disappointment of not reaching
Khartoum, and the sudden cessation of their active
efforts, had a depressing effect upon the whole force.
Lord Wolseley, in his message to the Nile Column ordering
it to return, sought to soften the disappointment in
some measure by judicious praise.  'Please,' said he,
'express to the troops Lord Wolseley's high appreciation
of their gallant conduct in action, and of the military spirit
they have displayed in overcoming the great difficulties
presented by the river.  Having punished the Monassir
people for Colonel Stewart's murder, it is not intended to
undertake any further military operations until after the
approaching hot season.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Soudan abandoned
</span>
</p>

<p>
When once more the expedition headed down-stream,
difficult as they had found it to ascend, the return
movement was even more risky and dangerous.  The eighty-five
Canadian steersmen were now found to be invaluable, or,
as one has remarked, 'were worth their weight in gold.'  Boat
after boat with their loads of troops came down at
lightning speed in order of two fathoms' length between
each boat.  It required a quick eye and steady steering
to avoid collision or being thrown on the rocks, for half
a second was as good as a wreck when shooting madly
between the sunken rocks of the cataracts.  A few boats
came to grief, but only one belonging to the Black Watch.
And so Wauchope and the other wounded were steered
down the great river&mdash;perhaps the most wonderful stream
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P105"></a>105}</span>
in this world of ours&mdash;to Meraivi.  Rochefoucauld has said
that strong minds suffer without complaining, while weak
ones complain without suffering.  Wauchope's exemplary
patience under such trying and painful circumstances, we
have been told, was extraordinary.  He was ever cheerful,
and not a murmur escaped his lips.  At Meraivi the regiment
erected huts and an hospital, and remained for two months,
but were always on the alert night and day against
threatened attacks by unfriendly Arabs.  The Government
ultimately abandoned the idea of the reconquest of the
Soudan at that time.  It was left to its fate in the hands
of the victorious Mahdi, all the troops being recalled.
Leaving the boats at Akasheh on 8th June, the Black
Watch took train for Wady Halfa, thence to Assouan,
then by steamers and <i>diabehas</i> to Assiout, and thereafter
by train to Cairo, which was safely reached on the morning
of the 27th June, Lord Wolseley telegraphing to London,
'The Black Watch has arrived in splendid condition, and
looking the picture of military efficiency.'
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wauchope's services in the Nile Expedition of
1884-85 were acknowledged by two clasps to his Egyptian
medal, inscribed Nile and Kirbekan.
</p>

<p>
It is a significant commentary upon the modesty of the
man, that while the records of the regiment at this time,
from which we have gathered these particulars of its
movements in the Nile Expedition, were compiled by Colonel
Wauchope himself, Colonel Bayly, who was then its
commanding officer, has pointed out to us 'that just for that
reason we will find his name less mentioned than it ought
to be.'
</p>

<p>
The Black Watch returned to Cairo, where they remained
for over a year, during which time Wauchope had quite
recovered from his wounds and was able to resume duty.

Malta and Gibraltar
</span>
</p>

<p>
On the 30th April 1886 the regiment left Cairo, sailing
from Alexandria in the steamship <i>Poonah</i> under orders
for Malta, and reaching that interesting island on the
5th May.  During the three years that followed, when the
42nd were quartered there, and afterwards at Gibraltar,
Colonel Wauchope was several times home on leave of
absence, but not for any lengthened period.  During
these years, the 42nd had the round of the various barracks
with which that important military station is
studded&mdash;Ricasoli, St. Elmo, Floriana, Gozo, and Pembroke Camp.
The last, which is about two miles west of the harbour
and fortifications of Valletta, was occupied for a time
when the troops were engaged in firing practice, and one
gentleman who was then in Malta, acting as assistant to
Dr. Wisely, the resident chaplain, mentions that he always
found the Colonel exceedingly kind, occasionally asking
him to join the officers' mess, and showing him much
attention.  From frequent intercourse with him, he formed
the impression that 'he was one of the most modest and
unassuming of men; and, he might add, one of the most
sensible.'
</p>

<p>
But Wauchope's influence and personality were not
limited to his military duties, or to the British soldiers
merely.  He had a great deal to do with the Maltese,
especially in connection with the formation of a Malta
Militia.  We are told by Dr. Wisely that he 'entered into
the organisation of a body of native militia with his
usual thoroughness; and,' he says, 'by none was he more
respected than by the native inhabitants of the island.
The Maltese loved him.  When the news came of his death,
some of them I know wept for sorrow.'
</p>

<p>
At the sale of the whale-boats of the Nile Expedition,
Wauchope purchased two or three of them, and had them
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P107"></a>107}</span>
sent to Malta, where they were largely used, and to good
effect, by his men for recreation purposes.  With a good
deal of the sailor in him, he encouraged races and aquatic
sports in and about Valletta, he himself taking an active
personal interest in them, and being a good deal out with
the boats.
</p>

<p>
His old shipmate of the <i>St. George</i>, Prince Alfred, who
had now been created Duke of Edinburgh, and was then
serving as captain of one of the warships in the Mediterranean,
and afterwards as commander-in-chief of the Malta
station, came a good deal in contact with Wauchope at
this time.  There was a frequent interchange of visits
between them.  'The Duke,' says Colonel Bayly, 'had
always the greatest regard for Wauchope, calling him, as
of old, by his Christian name of Andy, and showing the
utmost friendship.'  In this way the otherwise tedious
routine of garrison duty was considerably lightened.
</p>

<p>
In June 1889, Wauchope was honoured by having
conferred upon him by Her Majesty the distinction of
Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, in
recognition of his splendid services in Egypt.
</p>

<p>
On the 8th August, the battalion of the Black Watch
left Malta for Gibraltar in H.M.S. <i>Himalaya</i>, and
disembarked at the Rock on the 13th, taking up their
quarters in the south barracks.  The regiment had a
prolonged stay of nearly three years at Gibraltar, but during
that period Colonel Wauchope, in addition to his being
home several times on furlough, had frequent opportunities
of making visits in Spain and on the coast of Algiers and
Morocco.  His actual term of foreign service only extended
to February 1891, when he returned to Scotland to take
the command of the 2nd Battalion at Maryhill Barracks,
Glasgow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P108"></a>108}</span>
</p>

<p>
During his residence at Gibraltar in 1890, he twice over
occupied for a time a rather unusual position, being called
upon to take command of the garrison.  While actually in
charge of only a company, he also commanded the battalion
owing to the temporary absence of Colonel Gordon on
leave.  The major-general having been called away at the
same time, Wauchope, by virtue of his army seniority, took
over the command of the infantry brigade of four regiments
as well.  None were quicker than himself to see the
possibilities of this peculiar situation.  As he put it, with
a humorous smile&mdash;'Now, suppose a man of my company
has a complaint to make, and I decide against him, as I
probably should: his remedy is to appeal to the officer
commanding his regiment, and he gets Andrew Wauchope
again to judge the case.  His next appeal would be to the
general, and again he comes before Andrew Wauchope;
but being only human myself, I fear he would find the
decision confirmed, and he would go away with the
reflection, that it was "Andrew Wauchope all along the
line!"'
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say this problematical contingency never
arose, and so he was saved from acting in any such triple
capacity.

CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p class="t3">
THE MIDLOTHIAN CAMPAIGN
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'A Scot of the Scots,' General Wauchope was a man of
many parts.  Great in arms, he was equally great in the
arts of peace; and in the political world, strangely enough,
he carved out for himself a reputation quite unique.
Though his countrymen were naturally proud of his
distinguished services as a soldier, they knew him also, it has
been well said, as the man who by pertinacious pluck and
sweet conciliation brought down Mr. Gladstone's majority
in the county of Midlothian.  Liberal politicians both in
England and Scotland will not have forgotten the horrified
astonishment with which they read the figures of the poll
in that county at the General Election of 1892.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Gladstone had been returned for the metropolitan
county of Scotland in 1880, after his great campaign, by a
small majority against the present Duke of Buccleuch, at
that time Earl of Dalkeith.  That was under the old and
restricted franchise.  In 1885, when the miners and farm
hands had largely through his influence obtained votes,
he defeated Sir Charles Dalrymple&mdash;a man respected by all
who knew him, and by many who did not&mdash;by two to one,
and something over.  Nobody thought any more about
Midlothian.  It was regarded as Mr. Gladstone's
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P110"></a>110}</span>
stronghold, and the Liberals went to sleep in the comfortable
assurance that the seat was theirs so long as he lived.  Nor
were their slumbers disturbed by the unopposed election
of July 1886, when throughout the country the Liberal
party suffered a serious defeat consequent upon
Mr. Gladstone's attempt, as Prime Minister, to pass what was
popularly known as the Home Rule Bill for Ireland.
Mr. Gladstone retained his seat, but was obliged to resign his
position as First Lord of the Treasury; and the Home Rule
Bill in course of the next six years, under the administration
of Lord Salisbury, became practically a thing of the past.
During that time remarkable changes were effected in the
constituency.  In Edinburgh the Conservative party had
rallied.  Its leaders did not lack courage, even under the
most hopeless circumstances, and they resolved to bring
forward one whose determination and courage had been well
tried, though in an entirely different field.  At a meeting of
the Midlothian Liberal Unionist Association in Edinburgh
on the 18th November 1889, the proposal of the committee
to adopt Colonel Wauchope of Niddrie as their
representative was unanimously carried.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Opposes Mr. Gladstone
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was admitted on all hands that his acceptance of such
a proposal involved the undertaking of a very hard task:
one speaker at the meeting even going so far as to say that
'while he did not anticipate they were to win the county,
he was sure that if Colonel Wauchope led this forlorn hope,
it would not be an inglorious defeat.'
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the rather doubtful prospects of success
which his supporters gave, Wauchope's reply was
characteristic of the man.  He accepted the honour and the
responsibility all the more readily, it would appear, that it
was accompanied by difficulties.  After thanking the
meeting for asking him to come forward at the next election,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P111"></a>111}</span>
he said he should be more than human if he did not
feel deeply gratified.  If he had been an orator, or if he
had been a man engaged in public affairs, he would not
have been surprised.  But though he was an utterly untried
man, he would do his best to try and serve, he should not
say their interests, but the interests of the cause which
they had all at heart.  He was sure they would rally round
the old flag&mdash;the flag of the Union.  It spoke well for the
future of Unionism throughout the land; and their native
county of Midlothian had in this respect shown a good
example to the rest of the country.  They must never lose
sight of the fact that this battle that was going on now was
not a battle only in Midlothian, but it was a battle 'all
along the line,' from Land's End to John o' Groats.  They
were only a mere part of that fight; and if it were a
'forlorn hope' here, it was of the greatest advantage to
the great cause that they made a good 'forlorn hope' of
it!  He felt the responsibility very much to play the
part of leader to them when they might so easily have got
a better one.  'However,' he said, 'the choice is with you.
I did not seek it, but shall do my best to come to the end
of the business in a proper way.'  Here it will be seen
there was both boldness and modesty, confidence in
the cause he was to champion, and self-reliance, without
overrating his ability for the hazard.  His opposition
to Irish Home Rule and the possible disintegration of the
Empire made him fearless, even to the extent of daring
to oppose in person the great commander-in-chief of the
Home Rule army.
</p>

<p>
At this time he was home from Gibraltar for a short
furlough, and with evidently no expectation of taking
any prominent part in politics; and so, his term of leave of
absence having nearly expired, he was unable to follow up
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P112"></a>112}</span>
his nomination by any active movement.  He accordingly
returned to Gibraltar on 4th December.  In January
following he got, however, a further leave of absence from
29th January till 31st May, during which time he took
full advantage of the opportunity.  Though there was
no near prospect of an election, he at once set about his
canvass with all the characteristic energy of his nature,
devoting all his spare time to addressing meetings of the
electors in the various villages and parishes of the county.
This preliminary canter over, he rejoined his regiment
at Gibraltar in June 1890, leaving politics all behind him,
and entering with fresh zest into his military duties.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Canvass of the Electors
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Liberal press of the country, as a rule, treated Colonel
Wauchope's candidature with the utmost indifference, if
not with contempt, regarding it as a foregone conclusion
that it would end in nothing.  Indeed, his splendid
audacity provoked the Radical party to mirth, and even
in Unionist circles there was much shaking of heads.  On
all hands, by political friends and foes alike, every
consideration and deference was shown, and he was listened
to generally in respectful silence, rarely with open
opposition; but his claims were not considered serious enough
to work out to a conclusion that would at all affect
Mr. Gladstone's position as the sitting member.  Was
Mr. Gladstone not the first statesman of the day, and the most
brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer of the century?&mdash;a
man who, it has been wittily said, 'could apply all the
resources of a burnished rhetoric to the illustration of
figures; who could make pippins and cheese interesting,
and tea serious; who could sweep the widest horizon of the
financial future and yet stop to bestow the minutest
attention on the microcosm of penny stamps and post horses.'
To oppose such a man seemed madness.  The feeling was,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P113"></a>113}</span>
however, more of pity that a good man should waste his
energies on a hopeless effort, than any fear of danger to
the Liberal cause.  The following, as the expression of a
Liberal editor, may be taken as a fair specimen of the
general feeling at the time:&mdash;'The answer to the question
of the Scotsman, "Where is the candidate for Midlothian?"
has at last been answered.  Colonel Wauchope is a good
and a brave man, and one almost regrets that he should
have been prevailed upon to lead a forlorn hope.  Almost
all that was said of Sir Charles Dalrymple when he
contested the county, may be said of the Laird of Niddrie.
His heart is in the right place.  He is justly held in much
esteem as a landlord and county gentleman, as well as for
his gallant services to his country.  Sir Charles is,
however, more of and perhaps a better politician, and where
HE failed, Colonel Wauchope can have little chance of
success.'
</p>

<p>
These pessimistic effusions had no more effect upon
Wauchope than water on a duck's back.  He had given
his word, the die was cast, and deliberately and systematically
he carried out his resolution.  Beginning at his own
village of New Craighall&mdash;chiefly inhabited by the miners
belonging to the coal-pits on his estate&mdash;he commenced his
campaign in the schoolroom on 10th February 1890, his
friend and neighbour Sir Charles Dalrymple acting as
chairman.  In the course of his speech, Sir Charles referred
to the difficult task Colonel Wauchope had undertaken, but
was of opinion that his experience in the army had taught
him not to shrink from a task because it was difficult.
Indeed, he thought that to Colonel Wauchope a task of
difficulty was more attractive than an easy one.  He was
above all things plain-spoken and thorough, and if he
made statements on public questions, they might be sure
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P114"></a>114}</span>
that he would not have to answer them or explain them
away at a subsequent period.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary we should follow his footsteps
throughout the county on this first round of addresses
to the electors, or of his second round the following year,
when he again returned from Gibraltar, and finally in 1892
when the general election took place.  His personal canvass
too of nearly fifteen thousand electors was a remarkable
experience, and was conducted by him with much tact.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Electioneering difficulties
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say these repeated appearances proved an
excellent training for him in the art of public speaking.  He
addressed the electors on all subjects of public importance
from Home Rule as the all-absorbing question of the day,
to questions of Imperial and local interest.  It must be
admitted his early speeches bore the unmistakable signs
of the amateur in platform oratory, and when too hard
pressed by a pertinacious heckler he had sometimes to
admit he was nonplussed, but that he would give the
embarrassing question his full attention, and express his
opinion on it when he had formed it.  This want of
experience told heavily against him, and frequently he had
difficulty in getting a hearing, or in being able clearly to
express his views on some of the topics dealt with.  But
a breakdown did not put him very much out; he always
managed to please his audience before he was done, with
some happy remark given with the utmost good-nature.
His utterances, sometimes diffuse and incoherent at first,
very soon grew in confidence as well as in clearness, and
before the election was over there were few public speakers
better able to command the attention of a large audience
than Andrew Gilbert Wauchope of Niddrie.
</p>

<p>
As he progressed in fluency of utterance he grew in
popularity.  The householders of the middle class
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P115"></a>115}</span>
certainly showed no sympathy for his claims, and almost
closed their doors in his face.  They were Gladstonian
to a man.  But, notwithstanding this, the Colonel gradually
acquired a hold upon the industrial and agricultural
workmen.  He had, as they said, 'a way with him.'  He talked to
them in every village about politics and about their own
lives.  He never indulged in personal abuse of
Mr. Gladstone&mdash;on the contrary, when he did refer to him it was
always with the utmost respect, as one or two of his speeches
before us testify.  As a rule, the working classes are not
slow to recognise a gentleman, and they soon found the
Colonel was one to the back-bone; one who had a human
heart and could do a kind deed.  At a meeting in the
early part of the campaign, a mining village had crowded
its men into a hall to hear the man who dared to oppose
Mr. Gladstone.  The meeting was very noisy, and ill-disposed
to listen&mdash;so much so that a speech was impossible.
When things were becoming serious, a smart-looking
working man, apparently in the thirties, stepped
on to the platform amidst the hubbub, much to the
Colonel's surprise.  Nobody knew what was coming, and
the singularity of the proceeding secured silence, in which
the unexpected orator spoke to the following effect:&mdash;'I
dinna ken very much about politics, but I was wounded at
Tel-el-Kebir, and a man came up to me as I lay on the
ground, and after giving me a drink from his water-bottle
carried me back to a place of safety.  That man is on the
platform to-night, and that's the man I'm gaen to vote
for.'  The effect was electrical; the Colonel was not only
listened to, he was cheered to the echo, and the incident
made a deep impression on many present.
</p>

<p>
Frequently, of course, he had to stand a good deal of
interruption and good-natured chaff, but he was generally
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P116"></a>116}</span>
ready with a happy retort.  'Does your mother know
you're out?' was shouted to him from the back part of a
hall one night in the middle of his speech by a roisterous
opponent.  'Oh yes,' quietly replied the Colonel
parenthetically, 'but she will very soon know that I am in!'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Tramping the constituencies
</span>
</p>

<p>
Another questioner, evidently thinking he had a poser,
put it to the candidate: 'If war breaks out, will you be
able to represent the county?' to which he returned the
laconic and crushing reply: 'My man, if war breaks out,
I'll be there'&mdash;an answer which at once evoked a ringing
cheer and turned the meeting largely in his favour.  Of
course he did not convert all the miners to his way of
thinking, but he managed to retain their esteem all the
same.  'I like ye, Colonel, but I canna vote for ye,' said
a conscientious miner to him one day, and doubtless the
Colonel appreciated his humble political opponent all the
more for his genuine frankness.  Few who were present at
his first political meeting in New Craighall schoolroom
will readily forget the difficulty he had in getting through
with the subject of land values.  After wandering over
half the Continent for practical illustrations, he at length
lost the thread of his discourse, and got into a hopeless
maze.  For a minute or two he stood speechless, while his
face became quite florid, as he fiercely pounded his left
hand with his fist in his own characteristic fashion.  A
happy inspiration came at last.  Turning his back upon
the audience, he suddenly seized one of the newspaper
reporters sitting near, and commanded him to stand up.
'What have you got down there?  Read it!'  With some
difficulty the reporter obeyed.  'That's not what I want
to say at all.  Put it out.  We can't have that go into the
papers; put it down this way,' and then he proceeded to
tell him what he meant to say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P117"></a>117}</span>
</p>

<p>
'I was miserably beaten,' he remarked next day to a
friend; 'but I've determined to master politics, and I'll
do it.' How he did it every one knows.  With a volume
of Gladstone's speeches in his pocket, he tramped the
constituencies, and on the eve of the election, at a meeting
of seventeen hundred persons in the Corn Exchange of
Dalkeith, which was even honoured by the presence of
cabinet ministers, the speech of the evening was admitted
to be that made by Colonel Wauchope.
</p>

<p>
All this involved, of course, active exertion, as well as
concentration of thought and study, and the very servants
in the house could see he was absorbed in thought as he
never had been before.  Even his walks about the grounds
were less frequent than before, for the things that used
formerly to interest him were passed unheeded by, as with
face to the ground he appeared to be thinking out some
problem or composing a speech.  In his room piles of
papers littered the floor, and the preparations for speeches
must have been enormous for one not accustomed to this
kind of work.  One night he had sat up late preparing a
speech, making cuttings and pasting them together to be
ready for reference.  In order that they might be
properly dried, he left them on the fender overnight, and
when the girl came in in the morning to put on the fire,
thinking it was a lot of wastepaper she used it for that
purpose.  Of course the Colonel made inquiries about his
papers, and for some time there was great consternation
among the servants when it was known what had happened,
and the admission had to be made that they had been
destroyed.  It was very different with him, however.  He
laughed the matter over, and told the poor girl never to
mind, as it was more than likely it would end in smoke
at any rate!
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P118"></a>118}</span>
</p>

<p>
By the end of March 1891 Colonel Wauchope had a
second time visited the whole of the constituency, or, as
a Radical paper put it, 'had been overhauling the
preserves of the Grand Old Man,' but admitting frankly, at the
same time, that 'he seemed everywhere to be received with
marked attention and respect.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An eventful night
</span>
</p>

<p>
One of the largest of these meetings, held in Dalkeith
on 31st January, gave him an opportunity of twitting the
Liberals upon their alliance with Mr. Parnell, and upon
the exposure made to the country by his having a bag of
lime thrown in his face, 'not by an alien Saxon, but by a
Paddy belonging to the soil, in the county of Kilkenny, in
the very midst of dear old Ireland.'  The great issue, he
said, now before the country has been wonderfully cleared
up, and he strongly believed that if the people of this
country could have the truth put before them, there would
be no more talk of Home Rule&mdash;referring, of course, to
the scandal connected with the Irish leader's temporary
retirement from political life by recent exposures in the
Divorce Court.
</p>

<p>
These peregrinations through the county brought Colonel
Wauchope in contact with all classes of people.  The very
reporters, whose duty it was to follow him and report his
speeches, he made friends of, and by all who had dealings
with him he was regarded as the most genial and generous-minded
of political candidates.  As one of them said, 'he
was affability itself, and gave the impression of regarding
the reporters as his personal friends.'  One of these
gentlemen has given us the following graphic account of an
electioneering visit to one of the outlying parishes in the
county:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="quote">
Once in the course of one of his Midlothian tours we had
something in the nature of adventure.  He was to address an
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P119"></a>119}</span>
evening meeting at Heriot, and arrangements were duly made
for the stopping of an outgoing express which left the Waverley
Station about six o'clock, as well as for the stopping of the
Pullman express in order to bring him back to Edinburgh.
The arrangement was so beautifully fine that it failed
disastrously.  To begin with, the departure of the outgoing train
was delayed for over twenty minutes awaiting a Glasgow connection,
and, to make matters worse, the fact that the village
of Heriot is about two miles distant from the railway station
had been totally disregarded&mdash;if, indeed, it was known.  The
result was that the candidate, his agent, and the writer alighted
at Heriot Station just about the time that the meeting was
announced to begin.  There was nothing for it but walking.
In a drenching rain the three of us set out for the
meeting-place.  When we had accomplished a considerable part of the
journey we were overtaken by a light country van.  The driver
on having our plight explained to him, readily gave us a 'lift,'
and in this way we reached Heriot about the time we ought to
have been leaving it in order to catch the train that was being
stopped for the express purpose of picking us up.  The audience,
it was evident, was not quite in the best of humour at having
been kept waiting so long; but the explanation of the Colonel,
and his candid, honest attitude won the hearts of his audience,
and he had an excellent reception.  A passage in his speech
on that occasion is worth recalling in the light of the event
over which all Scotland to-day mourns.  'People state,' he
said, 'that I am a warlike candidate; but, gentlemen, I have
twice or thrice been shot in the body already, and I declare to
you I have no great desire to be shot again.'  At the close of
the meeting we set out on the return trudge to Heriot, painfully
aware of the fact that the last train had gone, and not knowing
in the least how or where we were going to pass the night.
In the course of our march, I remember, the Colonel turned to
me and said seriously, 'I hope you don't get into any bother
over this?'  I assured him that he need have no anxiety on that
score.  'Because,' he added, 'I'll sign any certificate you
like.'  The remark was quite like him.  It reflected at once
the soldier and the considerate gentleman.  Well, when we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P120"></a>120}</span>
got to the railway station, we found that the train that was to
have picked us up, had passed quite an hour previously.  The
stationmaster, I remember, took in the situation sympathetically
at a glance.  If he was not a sturdy Unionist he must have
been one of the General's numerous admirers.  'There is
nothing for it,' said he, 'but to walk up the line to Falahill,
where we may have a chance of getting a pilot engine to run
you down at least to Dalkeith.' Accordingly the stationmaster
lit a lamp, and the four of us started to walk up the line in the
dark, wet night.  When we reached Falahill we learned with
intense relief that a spare engine was at that very moment
pushing up a goods train from Eskbank.  The train arrived at
the signal-box in the course of a very few minutes, and in the
course of a few minutes more the Colonel, his agent, and
myself had mounted the spare engine.  The engine-driver was a
brick.  He drove us down the hill like the wind&mdash;tender first,
by the way.  We alighted from the engine at the point where
the Dalkeith section debouches from the main line, and after
the chilling effect of our rough ride, at once started off at a
smart pace to walk to Dalkeith Station.  We reached Dalkeith
exactly at ten minutes to ten o'clock.  There were thus ten
minutes left to us in which to obtain a much-needed refreshment,
and we needed little persuasion to visit an adjoining inn
for the purpose.  We caught the last train from Dalkeith, and
were in the Waverley Station about half-past ten o'clock.
Many a time afterwards was that eventful evening recalled by
all three.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the spring of this same year (1891), when political
parties in Midlothian were busy preparing for the possibility
of a general election occurring in the following year,
a portion of Colonel Wauchope's regiment was ordered
home from Gibraltar, and he was posted to the Second
Battalion to be stationed at Belfast.  This transference
made him now second in command, with the rank of
Senior Major of the Black Watch.  He did not therefore
require to go back to Gibraltar again, but served the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P121"></a>121}</span>
greater part of this and the following year, first in Belfast
and afterwards in Limerick.

Third tour of Midlothian
</span>
</p>

<p>
In January 1892 Colonel Wauchope began his third
tour of Midlothian, carrying it on with energy for the next
three months.  Still the dogged determination to do well
and thoroughly what he had undertaken is patent in all
the steps of his progress.  The 'forlorn hope' was now
looking more hopeful, and his opponents were beginning
to take alarm.  At one meeting it had been insinuated
that Mr. Gladstone being an old man of eighty-two, he
was only working with a view to ultimately taking the
great statesman's place.  He repudiated the idea with all
the eloquence he could command.  'It had been said that
he was waiting to step into dead men's shoes.  That, he
thought, was striking a bit below the belt.  He certainly
could look any man in Midlothian straight in the face&mdash;ay,
into his very eye&mdash;and say that he was waiting to
fill no dead man's shoes.  He was telling the truth, and
nothing but the truth, when he said he hoped Mr. Gladstone
might live for many years.  He knew that a
greater statesman than Mr. Gladstone perhaps never lived
in this country; but, despite that, he was sorry to say he
could not agree with his policy.  Indeed, the more he
admired Mr. Gladstone's genius, and the more wonderful
he considered all that he had done, the more deeply and
the more profoundly did he regret the course he had
pursued in regard to the Irish Home Rule question.
There was no doubt that the greatest men had made the
greatest mistakes.'  Home Rule he characterised in another
speech as 'Federalism that would completely change the
character of the Government of the United Kingdom,' and
'he could not help feeling it was a measure which would
never be sanctioned by the people of this country.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P122"></a>122}</span>
</p>

<p>
As a counteractive to the Colonel's prolonged canvass, a
great Liberal demonstration took place in Edinburgh on
29th March, when, in addition to the great statesman
himself, Lord Carrington, Governor of New South Wales,
appeared.
</p>

<p>
Parliament was dissolved three months after, on 25th
June, and immediately the electoral battle was waged
with greater intensity.  Mr. Gladstone came down to
Edinburgh on the 30th June to begin a tour of the county,
and the eyes of the whole country were turned upon
Midlothian and the fate of the great leader of the Liberal
party.  Charmed with the flow of eloquence, crowded
audiences hung upon his lips, and, no doubt, led away
with the popular enthusiasm with which he was on all
hands greeted, Mr. Gladstone's supporters overlooked the
influence that had silently but surely been working against
his return, and were incredulous as to the possibility of
defeat, while a too confident committee were thought to
have relaxed their efforts.  One Radical writer had no
hesitation in saying, that 'as to the result of the election,
no one seems to have any doubt.  It is fully admitted
that Colonel Wauchope is in many respects an admirable
candidate, but to compare him with Mr. Gladstone is
looked upon by the latter gentleman's followers as almost
ludicrous!'
</p>

<p>
The result was nevertheless looked forward to with the
utmost interest.  Speculation ran high; and while the
odds were certainly in favour of Mr. Gladstone, an element
of uncertainty was daily growing as the polling-day drew
near, which only whetted public curiosity the more.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Getting into a funk
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was even said that the Colonel himself, in view of his
rapidly increasing popularity, was beginning to be
apprehensive that he was actually to be elected&mdash;a result he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P123"></a>123}</span>
neither expected nor greatly wished.  'I am getting into
a funk,' he remarked&mdash;whether seriously or not we cannot
tell&mdash;when his agents told him he was likely to win the
seat from Mr. Gladstone.  'You know, I don't want to go
into Parliament; I want to be Commander of the Black
Watch.'  He had stood forward when asked as the
champion of his party.  He had opposed what he considered
the errors of the Liberals.  He would have none
of Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule policy.  He was opposed
to the Disestablishment of the Church of Scotland.  He
was against the enforcement of an eight hours limit of
labour as an infringement of individual liberty, while
he held that the foreign policy of the country under
Liberal Governments had not always commanded public
confidence.  For three years he had earnestly and well
enunciated the principles for which he contended, but as
to turning Mr. Gladstone out of his seat at last, we can
well believe that he shrank from the bare possibility of it
as the day of the poll approached.
</p>

<p>
The Midlothian election took place on the 12th July.
Out of a constituency of 13,134, no less than 11,000
tendered their votes&mdash;or 84 per cent. of the total.  It
must be borne in mind that a large number of the returns
throughout the country had already been made, and these
in many cases showed in favour of the Liberal cause.
Indeed, Lord Salisbury's majority in the House of
Commons had disappeared, and each day brought additions
to the Liberal majority.  The party was naturally
elated, and so far as Midlothian was concerned it was
confidently predicted that Mr. Gladstone's majority would
not be less than 2500.  The result of the poll was made
known next day at the Edinburgh County Buildings before
an immense concourse of people.  It was one of the biggest
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P124"></a>124}</span>
surprises Mr. Gladstone's supporters encountered during
the General Election, so far certainly as Scotland was
concerned.  The counting of the votes was completed about
a quarter to one o'clock, and an unofficial intimation of
the result soon found its way outside.  It put
Mr. Gladstone's majority at 673.  There was a crowd of
some thousands in number on the street in front of the
court-house, and the announcement that Mr. Gladstone's
majority had been reduced below 700 gave rise to a scene
of extraordinary excitement.  The crowd surged up to the
door to hear the figures, and as the cry 'Gladstone in by
700' was passed from one to another, a roar of astonishment,
we are told, went up from a thousand throats.
The noise brought hundreds of more excited politicians
flocking to the scene.  Town Council committee men and
young men from the adjoining Parliament House of every
shade of politics hurried up to join the excited throng.
Blank dismay took hold of every Gladstonian countenance.
Some of them could nor restrain themselves, and the most
convenient object on which to vent their indignation was
apparently the Church of Scotland, which came in for no
little share of abuse as the cause of it all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Result of the poll
</span>
</p>

<p>
When it is recalled that in 1885 Mr. Gladstone had
been elected by a majority of 4631, and that in the
following year his return was not opposed, the figures of 1892
very well justified Colonel Wauchope's daring.  These
were, for Mr. Gladstone 5845, and for the Colonel 5150&mdash;a
majority for the former of 690.  In other words,
Mr. Gladstone had lost 2000 votes, and Colonel Wauchope
had polled nearly 2000 more than had been recorded for
Sir Charles Dalrymple in 1885.  Neither of the candidates
happened to be at the County Buildings when the declaration
of the poll was made, so that after the first surprise
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P125"></a>125}</span>
was over the crowd dispersed.  It had been the intention
to have at once sent a telegram to Mr. Gladstone, who was
residing with Lord Rosebery at Dalmeny, but it is said that
so great was the perplexity among his supporters, that the
telegram though made out was not despatched till later on,
for, like the crowd outside, the people in the corridors
refused for a time to credit the figures.  Colonel Wauchope
had a most enthusiastic reception accorded to him at his
committee rooms in Princes Street, and on being called
upon for a speech, said he would not make a speech,
because he felt it to be true that it was the committee of
Midlothian that had won this victory.  It was, he repeated,
the committee; it was the men who had stood by their
guns at the committee rooms, the men who had assiduously
and earnestly worked for the cause&mdash;a duty he feared not
always of the most agreeable kind.  But they had done their
work well, and it was to them that they owed this great
victory&mdash;because it was a victory&mdash;that would resound
throughout the length and breadth of the land.  'It is true,
I have been the standard-bearer in this fight, and I hope I
have borne the standard not without discredit to myself.
But it is very little that a standard-bearer can do if he is
not supported by an army on the right and an army on the
left of him, and I am here to acknowledge that I have
been supported, and well supported, by a noble army both
on my right and on my left.  We have fought a good fight,
and a straight fight, and we have proved that the heart of
Midlothian beats sound enough.'
</p>

<p>
The result of this Midlothian election was admitted on
all hands, and by none more so than the Liberals themselves,
as 'a grievous surprise,' 'an eye-opener,' 'a severe
lesson.'  It was realised now that after all Colonel
Wauchope's candidature had not been quite the 'forlorn
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P126"></a>126}</span>
hope' they had at first predicted it to be.  As one of the
party papers afterwards remarked, 'They had been taught
the lesson that it does not do to depend too much upon
the individuality of any one, however eminent, to carry
a seat....  The advanced party was caught napping.'
... 'It is,' they said, 'most astonishing to find how well
Colonel Wauchope is respected in the constituency now,
and how much he has improved in his treatment of
political questions.  The outspoken and transparent
honesty of his character has made him troops of friends in
all quarters, and the attention with which he was received
both by friends and opponents at the various polling-booths
must have been gratifying to the gallant Colonel
himself in no ordinary degree, as well as encouraging alike
to him and his supporters to try conclusions again.'
</p>

<p>
Seldom has a defeat been reckoned so much of a
victory.  Those of the 'forlorn hope' were amazed, for
what at first appeared so hopeless had come within the
region of possibility.  Wauchope's name was on every
lip and at the point of every pen.  The Midlothian
election startled the political world, and sobered the joy of
Liberals; for even the return of a majority of members to
Parliament, sufficient with the aid of the Irish Nationalists
to turn out the Conservative Government of Lord Salisbury
and to place Mr. Gladstone in office, was, in the estimation
of many of that great statesman's admirers, scarcely
compensation enough for such a downcome.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Corn Exchange banquet
</span>
</p>

<p>
Immediately after the election, on the 18th July,
Colonel Wauchope was entertained to a house dinner by
the Scottish Conservative Club, at which Sir Charles
Dalrymple presided.  The Unionists of Midlothian also
recognised Colonel Wauchope's efforts and the sacrifices
he had made in the contest by a grand banquet given
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P127"></a>127}</span>
in his honour in the Corn Exchange, one of the largest
halls in Edinburgh, on the 20th August.  Beautifully
decorated for the occasion, and filled as it was by over
a thousand of the leading men of the party, and a large
number of ladies in the galleries, the banquet was a
spectacle of remarkable brilliancy and beauty.
</p>

<p>
The meeting was presided over by the Duke of
Buccleuch, who, in proposing their guest's health,
congratulated the company upon the occasion which had
brought so many of them together as representatives of
every parish in the county, after a fight in which the
interest of the whole country had been centred&mdash;a fight
which was looked upon a short time ago as a forlorn
hope&mdash;a fight with one of the most powerful men in the
kingdom&mdash;one who came down here, you may say, as the
idol of the people.  'It is unusual,' said his Grace, 'to
celebrate a defeat; I will not call it that.  I cannot call it
a victory, but I will call it a very great success.  It has
been a success that has astonished ourselves, but it has
done more than that&mdash;it has created consternation among
our opponents.  A few more, or, I would say, one more
success of this kind, will not only be a victory, but a very
great one.  For a majority of 4631 to have been reduced
on this last occasion to 690 is no small thing to have been
accomplished.  It has been accomplished by two causes,
or, I might say, three perhaps.  One was a first-class
candidate; the second was hard-working constituents;
the third&mdash;a very important one&mdash;was a good cause.'  His
Grace then referred to the Colonel's family as holding an
honoured place in the history of Midlothian for nearly six
hundred years, and to his own good qualities as a soldier
who had fought hard for his country's honour, and
faithfully served his Queen.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P128"></a>128}</span>
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wauchope's reply was at once modest, vigorous,
and humorous, but our space will not permit us to give it in
its entirety.  In his most light-hearted bantering manner he
referred to the consternation of their Liberal opponents on
hearing that Mr. Gladstone had only been returned by a
majority of 690.  'They said it must be a blunder; there
must be something wrong; a "one" dropped out from
before the "six"; it was absurd; the figure will be at least
1690.'  'Ah, but they looked, and they better looked, but
there was no number "one" before the "six."  The fact
was this, my friends, that Mr. Gladstone's majority was
down 4000, and so the news had to travel to Dalmeny,
where, I fancy, it was not received with great
cordiality!'  After complimenting the committee for the manner in
which they had all exerted themselves, and a graceful
acknowledgment to the ladies who had also assisted, he
concluded by thanking his supporters for the great
kindness he had experienced, and the great honour they had
done him, and sat down amid a perfect storm of applause,
the large audience once more rising to their feet, cheering
to the echo.
</p>

<p>
One of the other speakers&mdash;Mr. Martin, manager of the
works at New Craighall&mdash;mentioned that the miners of
Niddrie, who had supported the Colonel with loyal
devotion, were going to work on till they had returned
him as member for Midlothian.  And as an evidence of
their admiration, on the 17th December they also in their
own humble way honoured him with a banquet.  It was
given in the schoolroom of the village, and about a hundred
and fifty warm sympathisers were present, presided over
by Mr. Martin.  It was in every way a demonstration
creditable to the gratitude of the men for many acts of
kindness shown to them in the past, and a manifestation of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P129"></a>129}</span>
their personal esteem, which the Colonel was not slow to
recognise and appreciate.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Wauchope and Gladstone
</span>
</p>

<p>
A noteworthy feature of this contest between Colonel
Wauchope and Mr. Gladstone was the entire absence
of personal animosity.  Both candidates treated each
other, as they were entitled to do, with the utmost
respect.  This is not always so in the heat of political
warfare.  But Wauchope had the good sense to avoid any
reference to his opponent, and for long Mr. Gladstone did
not condescend to reply to any strictures upon his policy.
When Wauchope had decided to become a candidate for
Midlothian, he went to Sir Robert Biddulph, afterwards
Governor of Gibraltar, and told him he would have to
canvass regularly until the next general election.  Sir
Robert's advice was wise:&mdash;'I told him,' said he, 'that he
should never make any personal attack on Gladstone, nor
ever mention his name in his public speeches.  I said,
"Gladstone is so strong a man, and so powerful a speaker,
that he can tear you to pieces.  You should not, therefore,
give him the least opening for attacking you, but just act
as if no such man existed."  Some time after,' continues
Sir Robert, 'he reminded me of that advice, and said he
had scrupulously acted upon it, so much so that
Mr. Gladstone had never attacked him, and had even spoken
of him as a worthy and estimable man!'
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding his military duties, of which he was far
from being forgetful, amid all the political excitement of
1892, Colonel Wauchope, encouraged by the enthusiasm
of his friends, and still determined to uphold what he
considered Constitutional principles, though, at the same
time, conscious of his own deficiencies, continued his
candidature for some time in view of the possibility of
another election soon.  Writing from Limerick Barracks
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P130"></a>130}</span>
on 28th July 1892 to a friend in Dalkeith who had sent
him some complimentary verses on the recent election,
he says:&mdash;'Many thanks for your kind letter.  It is such
that repay me for any little trouble I may have taken in
the good old cause.  No one feels more than I do how
unfit I am in many ways for the position of candidate.
For instance, during next month we are to be at field
manoeuvres, and I am tied by the leg during that time.
But Midlothian deals very tenderly with all my wants&mdash;very
much, I take it, that I am one of themselves.'
</p>

<p>
It was his strong opinion that the Liberal policy of the time
was to prove disastrous to the best interests of his country
which made him so keen an opponent of Mr. Gladstone.
Against that great statesman he had not the slightest personal
feeling.  Speaking to a friend afterwards who was
congratulating him upon his having so nearly been returned to
Parliament, he said, 'I never expected to win the seat, <i>but
I wanted to hash their batteries</i>!'  Before long it became
apparent, however, that it would be a needless waste of
energy to continue the struggle; and, besides this, other
duties supervened, and Colonel Wauchope saw fit to
withdraw altogether from politics for a season.

CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p class="intro">
THE 73RD REGIMENT AT MARYHILL BARRACKS&mdash;INCIDENTS
OF HOME LIFE&mdash;MILITARY LIFE AT YORK&mdash;APPOINTMENT
TO SOUDAN CAMPAIGN.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In the autumn of 1892 Colonel Wauchope's residence in
Limerick came to a close on his appointment to the
command of the 73rd Perthshire Regiment, or the 2nd
Battalion of the Black Watch, then stationed at Maryhill
Barracks, Glasgow.  This well-earned promotion to a
position he had long aspired to occupy enabled him to
be more frequently at Niddrie than formerly.  During
the twenty-seven years he had been connected with the
Black Watch, he had risen slowly but steadily from
the rank of subaltern through the various intermediate
stages to the first position, by dint of persevering effort
and close application to his military duties.  He was by
no means a dilettante officer.  He loved his profession,
and he made it his life work, while the enthusiasm with
which he was inspired he imparted to those around him.
We find this exemplified in a speech made at a large
gathering of the old members of the 42nd held in the Trades
Hall, Glasgow, on the 17th September, where he presided.
Many of those present had been with him through the
Ashanti and Soudan campaigns, as well as in Cyprus,
Malta, and Gibraltar, and in referring to former times he
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P132"></a>132}</span>
recalled their relationship with no little satisfaction.  He
felt, he said, as if he was back at Aldershot under his dear
old colonel, now Sir John M'Leod, and once more an
ensign, and the adjutant of the 42nd.  But let them not
forget their comrades of the 73rd regiment.  Almost since
the beginning of the century, the 73rd had been part and
parcel of the 42nd, having been indeed the second
battalion of the regiment.  That alliance had been a
happy one.  Personally he had now served the second
battalion for eighteen months, and it had been to him a
period of great pleasure in his duties.  That which bound
them together and gave them so much in common was the
glorious traditions of the 42nd.  Their hearts warmed to
each other and the old regiment as they thought of
Waterloo and Quatre Bras.  But it was not only traditions
they had.  He saw men before him who had fought in a
European theatre of war, and who had taken part in the
great battle of the Alma, of which they were now celebrating
the anniversary.  He had spent twenty-seven years
in the old regiment, and the longer he was in it the better
he loved it.  In concluding an eloquent address, he said:
'The 42nd stood high in the esteem of the Scottish people,
for there was no regiment that Scotland loved more than
the "Auld Forty-twa," and well they might.  By sea and
by land, at home and abroad, the 42nd had fought and
always deserved well of its country.  Our old regiment
has become renowned chiefly, I believe, because of the
strict and stern yet good discipline exercised by such
commanders as Sir Daniel Cameron, Sir John M'Leod,
and others.  These men had always stood up for discipline,
and it was discipline that brought the soldier comfort,
whilst it was the reverse that brought disorder and
crime, and everything that was disagreeable.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P133"></a>133}</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
'Right-about wheel!'
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Colonel was not, however, always so successful as a
speaker.  An amusing incident is told of him when in
command at Maryhill Barracks which shows that an eloquent
man may not always have command of his tongue.  One
morning on parade he purposed giving the men an address,
and from the demeanour of their colonel the men anticipated
something eloquent.  The genial Andrew, however,
had only got the length of 'Men of the gallant 42nd,'
when his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth.
Thrice did he make the attempt, and thrice did he fail to
make progress, until, exasperated with himself, he suddenly
exclaimed, to the astonishment of the regiment&mdash;'Men of
the gallant 42nd, right-about wheel!'
</p>

<p>
But while the Colonel was strong in politics and diligent
in the discharge of barrack duties, he did not forget his
old ancestral home at Niddrie.  It was never his lot to
make anything like a permanent residence at Niddrie
House, but so long as he was stationed either at Maryhill
or afterwards in Edinburgh Castle he embraced every
opportunity of making short visits home; and when home
he never failed to interest himself in the welfare of all in
the neighbourhood.  In the spring of 1893, being then in
command in Edinburgh Castle, he had more frequent
opportunities of being among 'his ain folk,' and taking a
more active interest in their welfare than was formerly
possible.  It is with almost a smile we read of his
being at home at that time, and attending a meeting
mostly composed of miners and labourers in the Niddrie
School, to present prizes to the members of the local
Bowling Club, in whose success he took a lively interest.
A social meeting held after this ceremony was heartily
enjoyed by all present, the Colonel entering freely into
the spirit of the occasion, making himself the gayest of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P134"></a>134}</span>
the gay and 'everybody's body,' among men, women, and
children.  As one has well said, 'he had a magnetism
about him which not only made him the friend of all, but
made all his friends.'
</p>

<p>
It will be long before the people of Niddrie and New
Craighall villages forget his kindness to them.  One and
all while he lived regarded him with pride, affection, and
gratitude.  Nor is this to be wondered at, for he held
their loyalty and friendship by simple and unaffected acts
of kindness and helpfulness, never making them feel that
his friendship was an act of condescension, but rather the
outcome of a warm heart and a generous nature.  Their
acknowledgment of his services when occasion arose was
always spontaneous and sincere.
</p>

<p>
This was strikingly exemplified on the occasion of
Colonel Wauchope's marriage in 1893 to Miss Jean Muir,
the daughter of the venerable Principal of Edinburgh
University.  On the Saturday previous, the villagers and
others turned out in full force, and by their gifts as well
as by their presence showed how gratified they were with
the lady of his choice, and how their good wishes went
out towards them both.  Two bands headed the procession
to the mansion-house, and when the lawn was reached
the Colonel was presented in name of them all with a
silver punch-bowl, on a polished cannel-coal stand taken
from the Niddrie coal-pits.  The presents from the
school children, the tenants on the estate, and other
incidents of the day testified unmistakably in the same
way to the cordial relations subsisting between the laird
and his neighbours and dependants.
</p>

<p>
'A better man never lived' was the terse estimate of one
of the villagers when speaking of him lately, and the echo
of it will long keep his memory green.

Charlie Egan
</span>
</p>

<p>
One touching incident illustrating his goodness of heart
is told by the Rev. George Dodds, the Free Church
Minister of Liberton, as occurring about this time.  When
in command at Maryhill Barracks the Colonel one day
inspecting the hospital had his attention directed to a
boy&mdash;one of two brothers in the band of the Black Watch&mdash;who
was dying of consumption, and it touched the soldier's
heart.  Finding out that the boy was an orphan, he had him
removed to a room in his own house, the Colonel himself
accompanying the lad from Glasgow to Niddrie, where
every possible attention was paid to him.  Dr. A. Balfour
of Portobello was asked to look after the case, and it was
the Colonel's wish that a nurse should attend him.  The
lad, however, got so attached to the housekeeper at
Niddrie&mdash;one of the kindest and most faithful of
servants&mdash;that he would have no other attention than hers.
During all the illness of the brave little chap, no one
knows but the kindly nurse, the doctor, and the minister,
the Colonel's tenderness and anxiety and unstinted
generosity towards his little friend.  When at length after
some weeks he died, it was a sight not to be forgotten,
how at the close of the funeral service he stood weeping
at the head of the coffin which was laid on trestles in the
hall.  It was a stormy wintry day at the end of April, the
snow lying thick on the ground; but, following the bier,
he walked uncovered through the snow with all the
reverence of a bereaved man to the grave in the little private
burying-ground in the Niddrie policies, where the young
soldier, whose closing weeks of life he had soothed so
tenderly, was laid to rest by his comrades from Edinburgh
Castle.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Charlie Egan, with only his fifteen summers
over his head, truly found in his commanding officer one
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P136"></a>136}</span>
who was touched with the truest Christian sympathy, and
acted well towards him the part of the Good Samaritan.
Such conduct is a noble example.  It is the secret of lasting
popularity.  It is more,&mdash;it is the secret of true happiness.
</p>

<p>
In 1894 occurred a protracted strike among the colliers
throughout the country.  The Niddrie coal-works were
affected by it, and for seventeen weeks the men were out
of employment, and their families suffering the severest
hardship.  On this question he expressed himself at a later date
most forcibly in these words:&mdash;'I do not know anything
to a patriotic mind more terrible for the country, and bad for
it, than anything in the shape of strikes&mdash;those industrial
wars which the country has witnessed and which had been
an evil thing in every way.  I know it will be said that
I am a man of war, and that I love war, and all that
sort of thing.  Never was there a greater fable.  Though
I have never had to stand on a great European field of
battle, I have seen too much of war in all its horrible
aspects not to hate it in every sense of the word.  In the
same way with those industrial wars, there is nothing
more deplorable and nothing which has tended more to
unhappy homes, and all the consequences thereof.'  But
the Niddrie miners were in sore straits, and a deputation
of them went to the Colonel to lay their case before him, and
they did not appeal in vain.  He told them very plainly
he had no sympathy whatever with the strike; 'but man,
Tam,' addressing the leader of the deputation, 'I would
rather do anything than see the women and weans starving,'
and there and then he promised to give one pound daily
to keep the soup-kitchen going, so that they might at least
have one good meal a day.  Not only so, but as long as
the strike lasted, vegetables in abundance were supplied
from the Niddrie House gardens.

The country gentleman
</span>
</p>

<p>
In New Craighall there is a large reading-room and
bagatelle-room.  Many years ago the building was erected
by the Wauchope family for a school, and was used as
such up till 1896, when it was superseded by the large
school erected by the Board at Niddrie Mill.  Niddrie
bowling-green, gifted to the villagers lately by Sir Charles
Dalrymple, has been a great boon to the men; and
Colonel Wauchope contributed largely to the expense
connected with its formation.  A bleaching-green in the
centre of the village&mdash;part of it fenced off for football;
the local football club; the local brass band&mdash;these were
all objects of his liberality.  Was a site for a church or a
chapel wanted, it was given ungrudgingly, and his grounds
were thrown open for Sunday-school excursions and picnics
during the summer months.  In cases of accident to any
of the miners, he had an ambulance waggon ready at the
collieries, and in many other ways he indicated his interest
in the villagers.
</p>

<p>
Similar instances of generosity among the people of
Town and Kirk Yetholm&mdash;where the other family estate
is situated&mdash;made him, we are told, the 'admired of all
admirers.'  There he bestowed large monetary help in
providing better water supply and sanitary requirements for
these villages.  In Yetholm district he was an open-handed
benefactor, and will probably be longer remembered as such
than for his warlike achievements.  And all this kindness was
done without ostentation.  It was the outcome of a noble
and generous disposition.  'No man is truly great who is
not gentle,' it has been wisely remarked, for a gentleman
must be kind and considerate for others; and though the
work of a soldier is to fight, and if need be to kill, he is all
the stronger in his hour of struggle against the enemy that
he carries within him a gentle heart.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P138"></a>138}</span>
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wauchope's heart was in the right place, and
his influence was consequently far-reaching.  It is told of
him that one day he had as a companion in a country
walk an ex-brother officer, not very popular among the
private soldiers.  As they sauntered along, they
forgathered with a big boisterous bully who had been
drummed out of his regiment, taking with him a rankling
ill-will against this officer.  He gave vent to his wrath
against the Colonel's companion, and threatened that he
would 'do' for him, showing at the same time every
disposition to carry his threat into effect; but Wauchope
promptly stepped between the two, when the rowdy
somewhat changed his manner, saying, 'Captain, I would not
lift a hand against so gallant an officer as you; it is lucky
for Mr. &mdash;&mdash; that you are with him,' whereupon the Colonel
lectured him upon the impropriety of his conduct, and
with sundry other good advices parted from him by leaving
a silver coin in his hand.  This was too much for the
man, and he burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
Nor was he above doing a kindly action, even though
asked in not the most polite fashion.  Once he happened
to be visiting his friend Sir Charles Dalrymple, at
Newhailes, dressed in plain rustic costume.  He had scarcely
entered the grounds, and closed the gate behind him,
when he heard a shrill voice calling out, 'Hae, man! come
and open the gate, will ye?'  Looking round,
Colonel Wauchope descried two fish-women with their
creels on their backs, vainly endeavouring to effect an
entrance.  On the request being repeated, he at once
turned back, politely opened the gate, and walked on!
They had taken him for one of the workmen, and were
rather disconcerted when they afterwards discovered who
had been acting the part of porter for them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P139"></a>139}</span>
</p>

<p>
Such acts of courtesy came natural to Colonel Wauchope:
they were not put on for occasion.  Whether in openhanded
generosity and hospitality, or in the mere opening
of a gate, he exemplified Emerson's idea of what a
gentleman should be.  As that writer expresses it, 'When I view
the fine gentleman with regard to his manners, methinks
I see him modest without bashfulness; frank and affable
without impertinence; obliging and complaisant without
servility; cheerful and in good humour without noise.
These amiable qualities are not easily obtained, neither
are there many men that have a faculty to excel this way.
A finished gentleman is perhaps the most uncommon of
all the characters in life.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The miners' strike
</span>
</p>

<p>
Colonel Wauchope stood well by the miners through
their long enforced idleness, with all its concomitant
troubles, and when the time of distress was at last over
and the pits had resumed work, the men determined to
show their appreciation of his conduct by a public
recognition of their esteem.  On the 3rd May 1895, a large
gathering took place in the New Craighall schoolroom,
presided over by the manager of the works, when an
illuminated address expressive of their gratitude, affection,
and admiration, was presented to him in a silver-mounted
casket.  That he valued such an expression of affection
from 'his own people,' as he liked to call them, goes
without saying.  In acknowledging the gift he said: 'This
address will stand foremost among our household gods.
On the face of it is a view of the old house of Niddrie,
where for centuries my forefathers have lived before me.  I
will say that in distant lands and in moments of danger,
my thoughts have always been of my old home and the
people of Niddrie and this neighbourhood.  And as to my
poor services, I feel proud when they are brought to the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P140"></a>140}</span>
notice of my own people in my own country.  And you may
depend, that when the hour of danger is, if there is one
thing that supports me in that hour, it is the knowledge
that those at home are thinking about me, and should I
fall, that their thoughts would be kindly towards me when I
am no more.'  Referring to a passage in the address that
spoke of his relationship as owner of the soil to his
dependants being ever of a kindly nature, he said: 'I
would be no man at all if I were not pleased to hear
that.'  Then as for the unfortunate strike some months ago: 'I
knew there were difficulties, and I stepped forward in a
small way to try and help my countrymen and women.  As
for strikes, I don't like them.  They are not good for our
pockets, they are not good for our tempers, and they are
unfortunate in every respect.  It is an ill wind that blows
nobody good, however, and that strike has done this good
for me&mdash;it has given me this presentation, which shall for
ever be valued.  The strike will also have done good
to the community, inasmuch as it has shown that when
difficulties are around us, and trials and tribulations come,
we can stand shoulder to shoulder.'  After a graceful
allusion to Mrs. Wauchope as one desirous of doing her
duty, and who in the address had been called his 'Gentle
Consort,' the Colonel concluded amid great applause by
thanking them all for the great kindness which had
prompted such a meeting.
</p>

<p>
It does one good in these times, when capital and
labour are too often in antagonism, to find such cordiality
of affection and identity of interest.

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Departure from Edinburgh
</span>
</p>

<p>
After three years' residence in Edinburgh Castle, the
and Battalion of the Royal Highlanders (Black Watch)
received orders in the autumn of 1896 to take up their
quarters in the city of York, and accordingly on 26th
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P141"></a>141}</span>
September they left Edinburgh, where they had so long
enjoyed the esteem of the citizens for their excellence of
conduct.  Colonel Wauchope and his gallant Highlanders
paraded at seven in the morning at the Castle Esplanade,
and although one hundred and seventy of the regiment
were at the time at Ballater as a guard of honour
to Her Majesty, the muster was five hundred and fifty
strong.  It spoke volumes for their discipline and good
conduct, that Colonel Wauchope was able to say as
the regiment was addressed before their departure, that
'there was not a single absentee from parade, nor yet
a prisoner.'
</p>

<p>
The Black Watch were garrisoned in York for the
following eighteen months, and both officers and men
gained for themselves in that ancient cathedral city much
popular favour.  Effective discipline and systematic drill
were never relaxed, and what they might lose in ease or
pleasure was compensated by admirable efficiency.
</p>

<p>
In the Sussex military manoeuvres of August and
September 1897, Colonel Wauchope with a brigade of
the Black Watch went from York to take a part in the
proceedings.  Joining the force of General Burnett, which
had fallen back from Waltham, and had bivouacked
overnight near Arundel, Wauchope's timely reinforcement
enabled him to retrace his steps westwards.  Passing
through the ducal Arundel Park, he struck across Houghton
Forest, deploying his battalions as the area of conflict
neared, and encountered the opposing force under
General Gosset, when some smart skirmishing (continued
for several days) took place at Burton Down, Dignor
Hill, and Bury Hill.  The attempt to drive Burnett and
Wauchope back over the river Arun, though gallantly
attempted, was ultimately declared by the umpires to have
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P142"></a>142}</span>
failed.  Wauchope and his brigade were reported as
having done splendidly.
</p>

<br />
GENERAL WAUCHOPE.<br />
<i>From a Photograph by arrangement with Mr Thomas Kemp, Dalkeith.</i>
</p>

<p>
In such exercises Wauchope was an adept.  In military
science he made it a point to be thoroughly conversant
not only with the details of drill, but in general strategy, to
be able to grip a given situation with comprehensive tact.
A born soldier, he instinctively realised what was the
right thing to do and the right time to attempt it.  Nor
was he the man to ask his men to do anything that he
would not himself do, or take a part in.  When in
Edinburgh Castle it was his habit, in order to keep the
regiment up to the fighting standard of physical
endurance, to march them out a nine or ten miles round of
country, and that in all sorts of weather; sunshine or rain
apparently made no difference.  Frequently have we seen
him swinging along at the head of his men, sometimes on
horseback, but more often on foot, over roads inches deep
with mud.  Like most favourite officers, he had his pet
name.  As we have already said, the name by which he
was familiarly known in the Black Watch was 'Red
Mick.'  One day the regiment had been ordered out for
a march, and in passing a group of the men the Colonel
happened to overhear one of them say, 'Red Mick will be
going to ride to-day.'  The regiment was in due time
drawn up on parade, and addressed by their commander
as to the order of march; then looking the man who had
made the remark straight in the face, he finished up by
saying, 'but to-day Red Mick will walk!'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Military life at York
</span>
</p>

<p>
While the regiment was in York, Wauchope took a deep
interest in the benevolent institutions of the city, and
specially in the Scotch community.  He was the President
of the St. Andrew's Society, which, through his active
interest in its affairs, greatly increased in numbers and
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P143"></a>143}</span>
influence.  'He always,' says one who knew him there,
'let it be known that he was a Scotsman, and was proud
of his country.  The stirring speeches that he made before
the St. Andrew's Society are still remembered with delight;
and as an evidence of the regard in which his memory is
still held there, that Society is about to erect a tablet in
the Presbyterian church to the memory of the officers and
men of the Black Watch who have since fallen in battle.'
</p>

<p>
It was noticed also that the same chivalrous feeling of
relationship existed between him and his men as existed
formerly between a Highland chief and his clan.  His
interest in them and their families was ever showing itself
in kindly visits to the married quarters of the barracks,
in order to look after the welfare of the women and
children, so as to increase their comfort.  Fêtes and social
meetings were not unfrequent, and at Christmas time it
was his custom to have a well-laden Christmas tree, on
which were suitable presents for the children, while the
mothers had welcome little gifts of money distributed to
them.  All this, says the Rev. Alexander Stirling, minister
of the Presbyterian church, York, was at his own private
expense, and must have cost him not less than £50 on
each occasion.  In spite of the attractive splendours of a
grand cathedral, Colonel Wauchope preferred to worship
according to his accustomed manner in the simpler form
of the Presbyterian church.  There, too, by his
arrangement, the regiment worshipped in force, and he always
insisted upon a full complement of officers accompanying
the men.  Not only so, but, as Mr. Stirling informs us,
Mrs. Wauchope and the officers of the Black Watch were
in many ways helpful to him and his congregation, taking
a part in much of their church work, and showing their
loyalty to their Presbyterian principles in many ways.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P144"></a>144}</span>
</p>

<p>
In July 1898, Colonel Wauchope was selected by Lord
Wolseley to command a brigade in the expedition then
being organised under General (now Lord) Kitchener for
the reconquest of the Soudan.  The 42nd regiment was
not ordered out for this service, and so the time had
come when, after thirty-three years of close connection
with them both in peace and in war, that connection
must for a time be broken.  One of his brother officers,
writing afterwards of that period and the grief that was
in every heart over the prospect of losing him, says:
'The send-off he received at York when he left will never
be effaced from the memory of those who took part
in it.  I have never seen Scotch soldiers exhibit any
such emotion, or give way so thoroughly to their feelings.
They knew whom they were losing; they realised their
loss, and gave vent accordingly.'
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the circumstances, if touching, were
not without a dash of the ludicrous; but they show how
warmly attached the Black Watch were to one who from
the rank of subaltern had risen steadily to be their colonel,
and was now to leave them for the command of a brigade.
Many a man among them wished he had the chance to
accompany him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Send-off from York
</span>
</p>

<p>
The regiment was at the time camped out for summer
quarters at Strensall camp, about five miles from York.
On the evening of a hot July day, when Colonel
Wauchope was to leave for the Soudan, there was an open
mess among the officers, and the health and prosperity of
their departing colonel was enthusiastically drunk.  It
was arranged that he was to go south by the midnight
train at York, and as the evening hours sped on, the
regiment as usual retired to their tents to rest for the night,
after tuck of drum.  They did not, however, retire to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P145"></a>145}</span>
sleep, for no sooner were the wheels of the Colonel's
carriage heard than there was a general move.  It was a
little after twelve o'clock, and the men were stripped and
in bed.  But in an instant every tent was astir, and like
a swarm of bees the whole regiment broke loose.  Every
tent belched forth its quota of excited men, and without
taking time to dress they had surrounded the carriage,
cheering, and enthusiastically shaking hands with their
departing chief.  Many of them, with only their nightshirts
on, ran after the carriage a considerable distance,
still cheering as they went along!  It was such a send-off
as few officers ever experienced.
</p>

<p>
It is a striking testimony to the impression made during
these two years upon the community of the city of York by
this good Scotsman and his regiment, that at the unveiling
of a handsome marble memorial in the Presbyterian Church,
Prior Street, on the 26th November 1900, all classes were
represented, and the Dean of York gave expression to the
thoughts of many when he said that, although he never saw
General Wauchope until he came to York, and during his
residence there with his regiment it was not very often they
met, 'yet there was in some characters a sort of magnetic
attraction so that one felt at once drawn to them because
they were sterling material, true metal.  It would be
impossible to be in General Wauchope's company, and be
associated in any way with him, or to hear very much about
him, without feeling that he was not only a soldier of the
Crown but eminently a soldier of the Cross.  It was right
that his memory should be perpetuated in York, it was
right that it should be perpetuated in that house of God
which he specially identified himself with, and which
specially belonged to his nationality.'

THE SOUDAN&mdash;BATTLES OF ATBARA AND OMDURMAN&mdash;ARRIVAL

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Once more Wauchope found himself on the way to the
front for active service, this time back to the scene of
his former exploits in the Soudan.  Matters there, ever
since the withdrawal of the British and Egyptian troops
in 1885, when the then all-conquering Mahdi took
Khartoum and slew the gallant General Gordon, had gone on
from bad to worse.  Over-running the whole valley of the
Nile, the Egyptian boundary-line had been much
circumscribed, and was now fixed as far north as Wady Halfa,
the prophet holding almost undisputed sway over the
whole Soudan, except that part of it contiguous to the
Red Sea in the neighbourhood of Suakim.  On the death
of the Mahdi in 1885, his tomb at Omdurman became a
sanctuary, round which the faithful gathered themselves.
Under the sway of his successor, Khalifa Abdullahi of the
Baggara tribe, cruelty and oppression ground down with
iron hand every neighbouring tribe.  Military despotism
stamped out commerce, and trade and agriculture; the
people were ruined, and slaughter and devastation ruled
where formerly there had been prosperity and peace.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P147"></a>147}</span>
Even Egypt was not safe from the inroads of the Dervish
host, attempts being made several times to invade its
borders; but Tokar was their utmost limit.  In 1892, Colonel
Horatio Herbert Kitchener recaptured that town, but no
further attempt was made to regain lost ground till 1896,
when that officer, now Major-General and Sirdar, or
Commander of the Egyptian army, received orders to advance
up the Nile for the reconquest of the Soudan.  The days
of Egypt's weakness were past, for during the interval
between this and Tel-el-Kebir, when the then wretched
Egyptian army was smashed to pieces, English officers had
been actively licking into shape a new native force.  Drill
and discipline, combined with growing confidence in their
officers, had in those years built up an army able and
willing to dare anything.  The Sirdar was ready to fight
the Khalifa, but he realised that in an invasion of the
Soudan the real enemy to be faced was the Soudan itself&mdash;'its
barrenness which refuses food, and its vastness which
paralyses transport.'
</p>

<p>
These were the problems to be overcome by the general
who would conquer the Soudan and plant his flag on the
walls of Khartoum.
</p>

<p>
Science and engineering skill came to the rescue, and
with these under the guidance of a marvellous military
genius that took in every situation, and turned it to his
advantage, the enterprise was ultimately crowned with
success.  Hitherto military movements in the Soudan had
been either by camels and weary foot trudging, or by boats
on the Nile.  Kitchener determined upon Wolseley's idea
of crossing the desert between Wady Halfa and Abu-Hammed,
but not by camels.  He resolved to do it by
rail, and to build the railway as they marched.  It was a
bold stroke.  This is how it was done.  Starting from
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P148"></a>148}</span>
Wady Halfa, a surveying party set out for ten miles or so,
making a rough survey of the lie of the ground, marking
as they went the proposed course; about five miles behind
the surveying parties came working parties 1200 strong,
levelling and embanking where necessary.  Two miles
behind these came 550 platelayers, and half a mile after
them a gang of 400 men to lift, straighten, and ballast the
line.  One mile behind these again came 400 men to put on
the finishing touches, and the line was complete, but ever
progressing to its ultimate terminus, carrying forward its
own materials of rails and sleepers, as well as supplies
for troops on the march.  The credit of this great work
was largely due to the young lieutenants of the Royal
Engineers under the direction of Lieutenant Girouard, a
Canadian officer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
On the Atbara
</span>
</p>

<p>
It was steady, plodding work; slow, perhaps, as a
fighting campaign, but every mile of advance the army
made sure of its position, and was kept within touch of
Cairo.  The campaign of 1897 found the greater part of
the Sirdar's force as far as Ed-Damer, seven miles beyond
the junction of the Nile and the Atbara river.
</p>

<p>
Here a strong camp was formed and preparations were
made for encountering the enemy who were massing some
distance up the Nile at Matemneh, under Mahmoud, the
son of the Khalifa, and old Osman Digna.  These joined
forces at Shendi, about half-way between Berber and
Khartoum, their strength being about eighteen thousand
men.
</p>

<p>
General Kitchener, leading and directing every
movement, returned from Cairo in December 1897, having
arranged with the British Government for the sending out
of a small British force to assist the Egyptian troops
already in the field.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P149"></a>149}</span>
</p>

<p>
These were at once granted, and the reserve British
force at Cairo, consisting of the 1st Warwicks, 1st Lincolns,
and 1st Cameron Highlanders, left for the front, their
places being taken by several regiments sent out from
England.
</p>

<p>
With such generals as Hunter and Hector Macdonald
the Sirdar had worked his way up the Nile valley,
overcoming all difficulties, with his Egyptian force of some
ten thousand men and forty-six guns.  The arrival of the
British Division in two brigades under General Gatacre in
March and April added largely to the strength of the force.
The command of the First Brigade was afterwards given
to Colonel Wauchope, now promoted to the rank of
Brigadier-General.  How different his journey up the
Nile on this occasion from his experience fourteen years
before with the weary whale-boats!  Now, thanks to the
energy of the Sirdar, he could travel to Berber in a saloon
carriage.  Speaking of this afterwards, he said he was
never so struck in his life as when he saw that railway
across the desert, which did so much for the expedition.
</p>

<p>
Before his arrival at the front, however, one brilliant
fight had taken place.  Mahmoud had been discovered
securely, as he thought, entrenched some seventeen miles
up the river from Abador, or about forty from Atbara
camp; and it was not fitting, notwithstanding the difficulties
of transport by camels for twelve thousand men, that so
large a British force should sit down within so short a
distance of an enemy and not attempt to drive him out of
his position.  The forward order was given, and on 8th
April, after a long night-march, the troops found themselves
facing Mahmoud's zareba at Nakheila, on the Atbara.
</p>

<p>
The story of the attack has been given with all the
graphic skill of an eye-witness, by G. W. Steevens in his
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P150"></a>150}</span>
book, <i>With Kitchener to Khartoum</i>.  When the sun rose
behind the Sirdar's men, it revealed a stockade made up
of timber, and a ten-foot hedge of camel-thorn, with
entrenchments behind&mdash;a formidable enough obstacle to
face.  Without delay arrangements were made for the
attack.  The enemy's base rested on the river, and the
Sirdar, determined that he should not escape, formed his
force in a semi-circle round him.  At 6.20 the first gun
announced the advent of battle, and for an hour and
twenty minutes Mahmoud's zareba was pounded with shot,
shell, and rocket, after which the Egyptian and British
troops advanced to the attack all along the line.  Maxwell's,
Macdonald's, and Hunter's Egyptians deployed on the
right.  Gatacre's British Division had the Cameron
Highlanders in the place of honour, formed in line along
their whole front; then, in columns of their eight
companies, the Lincolns on the right, the Seaforths in the
centre, and the Warwicks&mdash;two companies short&mdash;on the
left.  The orders to these were, not to advance till it was
certain the Dervish cavalry, hovering to the left of the
zareba, would not charge in flank.  Behind all was
Lewis's brigade ready for any emergency that might occur.
Stirring addresses having been made by the leading
officers, the Sirdar called upon the men to 'remember
Gordon,' and all being ready, 'the word came, and the
men sprang up.  The squares shifted into fighting formations;
at one impulse, in one superb sweep, nearly twelve
thousand men moved forward towards the enemy.  All
England and all Egypt, and the flower of the black lands
beyond, Birmingham and the West Highlands, the
half-regenerated children of the earth's earliest civilisation,
and grinning savages from the uttermost swamps of
Equatoria, muscle and machinery, lord and larrikin,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P151"></a>151}</span>
Balliol and the Board School, the Sirdar's brain and
the camel's back&mdash;all welded into one, the awful war
machine went forward into action.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Attack on the Zareba
</span>
</p>

<p>
The Camerons no sooner got the word to advance than,
with a wild rush, the pipers meanwhile playing 'The March
of the Cameron Men,' they made for the zareba some three
hundred yards ahead.  Forward and forward, midst a rain
of bullets, they reached the hedge of camel-thorn.  In a
few moments it was torn to pieces and scattered like
brushwood, Gatacre being among the first to lay hands on the
obstruction, and the Highlanders were inside the stockade
and in the trenches, where now sprang out of the earth
dusty, black, half-naked shapes, running and turning to
shoot, but running away.  'It was a wild confusion of
Highlanders, purple tartan, and black green too, for now the
Seaforths had brought their perfect columns through the
teeth of the fire, and were charging in at the gap.'  The
enemy scarcely waited to fight, so impetuous was the rush
upon them, and they fled in the utmost confusion for the
river, where they were cut down by the pursuing cavalry,
and General Lewis's half brigade of Egyptians.
</p>

<p>
In the attack on the right, the Egyptian troops, led by
British officers under Generals Hunter, Maxwell, and
Macdonald, behaved with great gallantry, carrying all before
them.  The ground was easier on their side than that
covered by Gatacre's men, and they entered the zareba a
few minutes before the Highlanders, not a man flinching
from the encounter.  The battle of the Atbara&mdash;thanks to
British discipline and drill&mdash;definitely placed the blacks
and the once contemned Egyptians in the ranks of the
very best troops in the world.  In forty minutes the Dervish
host had been driven out of their lair, thousands of them
had been killed, and four thousand, including their leader
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P152"></a>152}</span>
Mahmoud, were prisoners in the Sirdar's hands.  The way
was now so far open to Khartoum, but the opportunity was
not yet.
</p>

<p>
Reserves and supplies were needed, and a strong base
had still to be secured before the final advance on the
Khalifa's capital could be attempted.  The whole force,
British and Egyptian, accordingly retraced their steps
down the Atbara river to El Hudi, where they struck
across the desert to the various camps they had formerly
occupied at Kenur, Darmali, Assilem, Berber, and Fort
Atbara, at the junction of the rivers.
</p>

<p>
The 1st Brigade of British, viz. the Camerons, the
Lincolns, Seaforths, and Maxim battery resumed their
quarters at Darmali, where they remained throughout the
summer.  By the month of August, however, when Wauchope
joined them, casualties in action and deaths and invalidings
from sickness had seriously affected the strength of the
brigade, though officers and men upon the whole stood the
climate well.  'The sick list had never touched six per cent.
There were not fifty graves in the cemetery; and most of
the faces at the mess table were familiar.'  The Lincolns,
who had come up over 1100 strong, still had 980; the
other three battalions were each about 750 strong, and the
Warwicks were expecting a further draft of men.  The total
strength of Wauchope's brigade would thus come to nearly
3500 men.  With eager expectation they now awaited the
order to advance on Khartoum.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Advance on Khartoum
</span>
</p>

<p>
The forward movement began on 3rd August, regiment
after regiment first concentrating at Atbara fort, then
being shipped by steamer up the Nile to Shabluka, where
they were to reform and make the remainder of the
journey in six marches on the west bank to Omdurman.
Even with several steamers at the Sirdar's disposal it
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P153"></a>153}</span>
was a tedious business, and occupied nearly a month.
Wauchope's brigade passed up in the steamers on the
14th August, a four days' voyage, and on the 23rd, when
paraded with the and Brigade, they were reported as 'in
splendid condition.'
</p>

<p>
On the 25th August, the 1st Brigade marched out of
Wad Hamed, and the scene is described by one who saw
it as a most imposing spectacle.  The four battalions of
which it was composed moved off with their baggage at
the bugle-call, taking the road in four parallel columns.
'Many of the men were bearded, and all were tanned with
the sun, acclimatised by a summer in the country, hardened
by perpetual labours, and confident from the recollection
of victory&mdash;a magnificent force, which any man might be
proud to accompany into the field.'  General Wauchope's
men were worthy of their commander, and it was, we may
be sure, with no little elation that he stepped out with
them that day on the way to their final triumph.
</p>

<p>
Keeping his forces well in hand, the Sirdar had the
whole army encamped at Wadi Abid on the evening of
the 29th, the British Division marching in by moonlight.
They were now within twenty-eight miles of Omdurman,
and the two following days' marches brought them
within touch of the enemy and in sight of the Mahdi's
tomb.
</p>

<p>
The 2nd of September saw the last stand for Mahdism
and its complete overthrow.
</p>

<p>
Resting their base upon the river, where they were
supported by five gun-boats, the British formed their
camp within a few miles of Omdurman, the Sirdar taking
the precaution to entrench in case of surprise.  Early in
the morning the Khalifa brought out his whole force,
computed to be about fifty thousand men, making a dead
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P154"></a>154}</span>
onset upon the British position.  If overpowering numbers
could have achieved victory he had it in his grasp.
</p>

<p>
But British coolness and pluck won the day.  The
Dervish host on horseback swept the plain with a rush
that no infantry could have withstood.  'They came
very fast, and they came very straight; and then presently
they came no further.  With a crash the bullets leaped
out of the British rifles,' Egyptians, Englishmen, and
Highlanders pouring out death as fast as they could load
and press trigger; while shrapnel whistled and Maxims
growled savagely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Battle of Omdurman
</span>
</p>

<p>
We need not describe the details of the fighting.  The
Khalifa's attack was speedily turned into a rout, though
many a brave stand was made by the Dervish host.
Attacked on two sides, the British force gradually spread
itself out like an opening fan, under admirable handling
by their generals.  At a critical point in the engagement,
when Generals Hunter and Macdonald in the front were
being threatened by an outflanking movement of the
enemy's cavalry, Hunter sent for Wauchope's 1st Brigade
to fill the gap between Macdonald on the right and Lewis
on the left.  The request went to General Gatacre first
instead of the Sirdar; but with the soldier's instinct he
immediately set the Brigade in motion.  Wauchope, cool as a
statue, took in the situation at once, and moved his men
forward as if on parade, while the Lincolns and the
Warwicks under his command&mdash;said to be the best
shooting regiments in the British army&mdash;did great execution,
and effectually kept the enemy at bay.  They saved the
position, for, as one correspondent has said, 'It was the
very crux and crisis of the fight.  If Macdonald went,
Lewis on his left, and Collinson and the supporting
camel-corps and the newly returned cavalry, all on his right or
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P155"></a>155}</span>
rear must all go too.'  Exposed to a withering fire, the
enemy were unable to withstand the steady discipline of
our men.  Defeated on all sides, the Khalifa turned and
fled.  Then was the time for our cavalry.  With a dash
the 21st Lancers made for the retreating foe, pursuing and
slaughtering up to the walls of Omdurman.  The bravery
of the Dervishes was unquestionable.  They literally threw
themselves upon the British lines, only to be overwhelmed
in a common ruin.  Over 11,000 of the enemy were killed,
16,000 wounded, and 4000 were taken prisoners, and this
by an army numbering not more than 22,000 men.  On
the Anglo-Egyptian side the losses were comparatively
light, killed and wounded not amounting to above 500.
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope was fortunate on this occasion in
coming out of the engagement without a scratch.  In some
respects the battle of Omdurman has been described as 'a
less brilliant affair than the Atbara.  On the other hand
it was more complex, more like a modern battle.  The
Atbara took more fighting, Omdurman more generalship.
Success in each was complete and crushing.'  Mahdism
was no more.  It died well.  'It had earned its death by
its iniquities, it had condoned its iniquities by its
death.'  Gordon was avenged.  And not only so, it was the dawn
of a new era for the long down-trodden Soudan, so that it
might in future be a country fit to live in.
</p>

<p>
We have already referred to General Wauchope's attachment
to Scottish Presbyterianism, and told how loyally and
consistently he adhered to the Church of his fathers.  From
the days when he was an ensign, it was known among his
brother officers as a <i>casus belli</i> to speak slightingly to him
of his Church.  He would stand up for Presbyterianism,
and would suffer for it if necessary, when its claims were
in danger of being thrust into the background.  A difficulty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P156"></a>156}</span>
of this kind arose after the taking of Omdurman, and it is
interesting to note how he acted.  Orders had been given
to all the chaplains, Roman Catholic, Presbyterian, and
Anglican, for a combined Gordon Memorial Service at
Khartoum.  The Anglican chaplain in Wauchope's division
intimated, however, that he would take no part in it if
the Presbyterian chaplain were to share in the function.
The General used what persuasion he could to move
the chaplain to a broader view of things, declaring that
he would not displace the Presbyterian, whom he
considered one of the best of men.  He was, he said, a
Presbyterian himself, along with most of his regiment.
At last, when persuasion failed, and the Anglican still
held his point, the General said, 'then there is nothing
for me but to report you to my General of Division.'  When
General Gatacre heard the story he reported the
affair to the Sirdar, who called the three
chaplains&mdash;Presbyterian, Anglican, and Roman Catholic&mdash;and said
laconically, something like this: 'You are each under
orders, and the man who disobeys must fall to the rear.'  This
settled the question; all of them took a part.  The
Memorial Service and the formal entry into Omdurman
and Khartoum, taken part in by all the troops, were most
impressive spectacles.  These over, arrangements were at
once made for the withdrawal of the greater part of the
army.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Welcome home
</span>
</p>

<p>
The troops returned immediately down the Nile, the
British regiments being shipped for England, where they
arrived in the early part of October.  A hearty welcome
greeted their arrival, all classes of society vying with one
another in heaping honours upon them.
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope hurried home so soon as he was
relieved of his official duties, and after a short visit to
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P157"></a>157}</span>
Yetholm, where he was received with great enthusiasm,
he and Mrs. Wauchope set out for Niddrie on Monday,
10th October, by train from Kelso.
</p>

<p>
It was only on the Saturday previous that the villagers
of New Craighall heard that the General was to return,
but short as was the time for preparation, the determination
to give him a hearty welcome was so enthusiastically
proceeded with that when he did reach it, the rather quiet
and dreary exterior of the village presented quite a festive
appearance.  Triumphal arches, flags, and streamers
floated in the breeze, and wreaths of flowers and
evergreens were everywhere visible.  It was the home-coming
of a victor, beloved by his neighbours, and well known
beyond the limits of his demesne.
</p>

<p>
At the Newhailes station, which was also gaily adorned,
the General and Mrs. Wauchope were received on alighting
from the train by quite a crowd of friends, among others
being Sir Charles Dalrymple and the Misses Dalrymple,
Mrs. Arbuthnot and Miss Muir, Councillor and Mrs. Cranston,
Edinburgh, Rev. A. Prentice, Rev. R. Burnett,
Liberton, Mrs. General Hoggan, and Ex-Provost Young,
Loanhead, with the whole village, men, women, and
children at their back.
</p>

<p>
It was a good-humoured, enthusiastic crowd, and at a
convenient part of the road the horses were unyoked from
his carriage and their places supplied by hundreds of
willing miners, who dragged the carriage up to the gate
of Niddrie Marischal, where it was given over to the
tenantry.
</p>

<p>
The procession was a long one, and was headed by the
school children, preceded by the local pipe band.  Then
came the Niddrie brass band, playing 'See the Conquering
Hero comes,' and after them appeared the members of
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P158"></a>158}</span>
the 'A. G. Wauchope' Lodge of Shepherds, bearing aloft
their banner with his portrait on it.  The incidents of the
march were many.  Some were amusing, some were
pathetic, but all told of the loyalty and enthusiasm of the
people among whom the General had his home.  Bunting
was displayed on all hands.  Women and children cheered
vociferously.  At the square of the village the first halt
was made, and an address of welcome in name of the
villagers was presented by Mr. Robert Wilson, one of
their number, in which expression was made of their pride
in the distinguished place the General had held in the
Soudan war, of their joy at his safe return from a battlefield
where the mention of his services by the Sirdar in
his despatches for the special consideration of the Queen
had caused them the utmost gratification.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Lord Kitchener, the Sirdar
</span>
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope, who was apparently unprepared for
such a manifestation of public feeling, made the following
reply:&mdash;'I can assure you that the splendid reception
you have accorded me is one which I shall never forget.
I know very well that much of it is owing to the fact
that we have been neighbours now for many a long year,
and there is nothing that gave me greater pride and
satisfaction than being told two or three years ago that
the people of New Craighall looked upon me as being one
of themselves.  In addition to that, there is another feeling
that has prompted you in this reception, and it is that in
me you recognised one&mdash;a humble one, perhaps, but still
one&mdash;of those who tried to serve his country under,
perhaps, difficult circumstances; and something is also due
to the fact that we have been completely successful in
planting our standards on the ruined palaces of Khartoum.
At Yetholm I said, and I am going to say it again, that fact
alone would be a great gain to civilisation and to the world.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P159"></a>159}</span>
If the Dervish power had been continued for any length
of time, hundreds and, perhaps, hundreds of thousands of
people who in the future will have a chance of living in
comfort and peace, would never have been able to live at
all.  It was a power based on murder, rapine, and cruelty,
and it was our bounden duty to put an end to that power,
because Great Britain was responsible for the condition
of things that existed in that part of the world.  Scotland
was well represented at the battle of Khartoum by two of
our Highland regiments.  (Here a voice shouted out, "Scotland
Yet!")  Yes, Scotland yet, and Scotland for ever, will
be the cry; and I can speak for those two battalions that
they in no way went behind from what other regiments had
done in other fields of our great empire; and you may be
sure of this, that our Scottish regiments will always be able
to show that high and distinguished valour and discipline
for which they have so long been noted....  It would
almost seem by the splendid reception you have given me
here, and which I have had in another part of Scotland,
that you thought I had played a very great part in the
campaign.  I feel bound, as an honest man, to disabuse
you of such a misapprehension.  The campaign was carried
out by a very great man, the Sirdar, Lord Kitchener, who
is a man of great ability, and who in the future
undoubtedly will shine as one of our great soldiers.  The
campaign was a marvel of organisation.  It was marvellous
how that railway was made across the desert.  Great credit
was due to the Sirdar, but I should like also to bring
before you another name&mdash;that of the general of our
division&mdash;General Gatacre, whose constant care and great
power of leading men aided the successful issue of events.
There is still another man I should like to mention.  He
is a Scotsman, General Macdonald, who led one of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P160"></a>160}</span>
Egyptian brigades.  He got his chance, and he was able
to take it, and certainly by his tactics, by his coolness, by
his perception at the proper moment, he had a great deal
to do with the success of the day; and it was a great
satisfaction to myself to be able with the brigade under
my command to go and support him on a somewhat critical
occasion.'
</p>

<p>
He concluded his address by a humorous reference which
pleased an audience of miners: to the effect that in the
near future he hoped the line to Khartoum would be
supplied with coal from the Niddrie pits!  As the
cavalcade proceeded, presentations of bouquets of flowers,
wreaths of laurel, and other kindly greetings marked the
General's way.  At the entrance-hall of Niddrie Marischal,
Mr. Thomas Skirving of Niddrie Mains, on behalf of
himself and the tenantry, presented an address of welcome.
This was feelingly replied to by the General in a few
well-chosen words, concluding as follows:&mdash;'No Roman
emperor coming from a victorious campaign could have
been half so well received as I to-day have been, and as
long as I live I can never forget it.  If there is one thing
that makes a man nerve himself to accomplish a difficult
task, it is the thought that he is thought well of by the
people in the midst of whom he lives.  I cannot tell you
all I feel&mdash;I should be more than human if I could.'
</p>

<p>
It may here be mentioned that General Wauchope
brought home with him one of the Khalifa's banners
which had been given to him by General Macdonald as a
memento of his timely assistance at the battle of Omdurman.
It is of white damur cotton, with a line of Arabic
in blue across its face inscribed, 'Mohammed Ahmed el
Mahdi Kalifat er Rasul.'  On a gold band on the staff is
the inscription, 'September 1898.  They were brave
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P161"></a>161}</span>
foemen, these Dervishes.'  This and other trophies now
find a resting-place in Niddrie Marischal.
</p>

<p>
A time of busy activity in metropolitan and county
affairs followed General Wauchope's return home, and
his high place as a public man was now universally
recognised.  His services were largely in request specially
in connection with public and social functions of various
kinds,&mdash;opening of bazaars of ladies' work, inspecting boys'
brigades, presiding at lectures and concerts, school board
work, county council work, and his duties as an elder of
the Church of Scotland&mdash;these all engrossed much of his
attention and a large share of his time during the winter
and spring following his return from the Soudan.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
At Windsor Castle
</span>
</p>

<p>
Honours also were heaped upon him on all sides, but
without in any way marring his simplicity of character, or
causing him to be any the less the plain, free and easy
approachable man he ever was, even to the meanest
hodman.  To high and low alike he was ever courteous
and considerate, and he most willingly lectured, or presided
at lectures, concerts, or meetings of friendly societies,
wherever he thought he could be useful.  For his
distinguished services in the Soudan campaign Wauchope
was now promoted from Brigadier to the rank of
Major-General, and towards the end of November 1898 he
received the Queen's commands to attend at Windsor Castle,
and had the privilege on that occasion of dining with Her
Majesty along with his brother officer Sir William
Gatacre&mdash;not the first time he had been similarly honoured.
</p>

<p>
Of course every other engagement must give way to a
summons of this kind; and Major-General Wauchope's
presence at a meeting in Dalkeith on the evening of the
same day had to be dispensed with, though much to the
disappointment of those who had come to hear him speak.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P162"></a>162}</span>
</p>

<p>
At bazaars he was always happy in his remarks, and
whether the object were the building of a new church, or
a manse, or getting up funds for a drill hall, he commended
it with earnestness and wit, and at the same time did not
stint his own contribution to the cause.  On one of these
occasions he was appropriately introduced to the company
by Dr. Gray of Liberton 'as a sincere Christian, a
true-hearted gentleman, a brave soldier, and a modest man.'
</p>

<p>
In the work of the Boys' Brigade and Volunteer
gatherings he was delighted to give his support, and was
frequently asked to take a part in their meetings both at
New Craighall and Portobello.
</p>

<p>
It was so characteristic of the outspoken candour of his
nature, that his inspections were not matters of formal
display, or the mere occasion of fulsome praise.  Drill to
him was business; and he was quick to detect faults, and
if needful correct them.  Once at an open-air inspection
of the Portobello Company of the Boys' Brigade, after
a thorough examination of the lads, he addressed them
upon the various points of drill, and emphasised certain
weaknesses noticed by him; for, as he expressed it, 'he
did not come there to tell them they were the best
creatures on earth, for he did not believe they were.
Taking all things into consideration, he thought they did
very well, but they might do better.'  The spectators were
somewhat amused at the critical attitude of the General,
but it was none the less appreciated, for on this subject
an ounce of criticism from him was worth a ton of praise
from any other person.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Liberton School Board
</span>
</p>

<p>
The same qualities of thoroughness and close application
characterised General Wauchope's conduct in the School
Board and Parish Council of Liberton, of both of which
he was for some time a member.  He was specially
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P163"></a>163}</span>
interested in the education of the young, and spent much
time making himself acquainted with the intricacies of the
code and details of school management, and on a recent
occasion it is recalled how at the annual visit of the
Government Inspector, he followed close upon the
Inspector's heels during his visit, in order that he might
fully comprehend the whole system of public school
education, and make himself familiar with its requirements.
</p>

<p>
On one occasion, in the absence of the chairman, Major
Gordon Gilmour, he was called upon to preside at a meeting
of the School Board, but having ridden over from Niddrie
House to Liberton Church&mdash;in the vestry of which the
meeting was held&mdash;in riding costume, with top boots,
spurs, riding-breeches, etc., he was reluctant to pose as
chairman.  Yielding to pressure, he, however, at length
consented, jocularly appealing to the reporters not to
<i>take off</i> his coat, or mention his costume in their report!
</p>

<p>
In the routine of parochial work the General took his full
share, and never shirked discussions on even the smallest
details of poor relief.
</p>

<p>
While he did not care to bulk largely in the public eye,
and was specially desirous that his private benefactions
should be known as little as possible, yet it was well
understood that he was an unobtrusive but most liberal
benefactor to the district.  Dr. Andrew Balfour of Portobello
gives the following instance.  'I remember well,' he
says, 'that ere he went out to Egypt as captain in the
Black Watch, during the Arabi Pasha rebellion, he said
to me, "Now, Balfour, I will trust to you to let me know
of anything going on at Niddrie in which I can lend a
helping hand."  It so happened at that time we started
reading and recreation rooms for the miners, so I wrote to
him, as he desired, with the result that he at once sent
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P164"></a>164}</span>
me a kind letter and an order for £25 to help the
scheme.'
</p>

<p>
His private benefactions were as a rule administered
with praiseworthy discrimination, as the following incident
will show.  Two little boys had been caught pilfering coal
and were lodged in jail.  On the circumstance being
reported to the General, he visited the little fellows in
prison, and learning the circumstances of their family, and
that their mother was a poor, struggling, hard-working
widow, he at once sent her half a ton of coals, and the
boys were liberated.
</p>

<p>
On the 14th April 1899, General Wauchope had conferred
on him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by
the University of Edinburgh.  The spring graduation
ceremonial in which arts, science, and law degrees are
conferred, is generally of an interesting character, but on
this occasion it was more than usually imposing.  This
was owing in some measure to its being performed in the
recently opened M'Ewan Hall, an adjunct of the
University, and the handsomest hall in the city; but more
especially from the fact that like honorary degrees were to
be conferred at the same time on Lord Wolseley, the
Marquis of Dufferin, and other distinguished men.
</p>

<p>
It was a magnificent spectacle, and the large audience
which crowded the spacious hall at an early hour in the
forenoon cordially greeted the General as he ascended the
rostrum to receive the degree from his father-in-law, Sir
William Muir, who as vice-chancellor presided on the
occasion.
</p>

<p>
In formally presenting him to the Senatus, Professor
Sir Ludovic Grant took occasion to say: 'It is a fortunate
coincidence that a graduation ceremonial which is honoured
with the presence of the Commander-in-Chief, should also
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P165"></a>165}</span>
include among its distinguished guests one who is so
noble an embodiment of all that is best and bravest in
the British Army, as is to be found in General Wauchope.
Here in Scotland his name is a household word, synonymous
with high courage and devotion to duty.  It were
superfluous to recall the occasions on which their gallant
commander has led the Black Watch to victory, or to
rehearse the long tale of all his exploits and all but mortal
wounds.  But it is not in his capacity as a soldier only
that he does with his might that which his right hand
finds to do.  There is not a miner in the village of Niddrie
who will not testify to the watchful guardianship which
he exercises over his people.  He has thrown himself
with characteristic zest into public affairs, and we all
know that the battle of the warrior is not the only form
of contest in which he has shown himself a dauntless
foeman.  The University rejoices to inscribe the name of
so gallant and public-spirited a soldier on her roll of
honorary graduates in law.'
</p>

<p>
That General Wauchope had not only won his spurs
but his doctor's hood in fair fight goes without saying.
His military services could not refuse him the former;
and it says much for the discrimination of the great
Scottish University that it should have discerned in one
whose scholastic education was of the smallest, and who
certainly had not the benefit of a university training, a
fitting subject for so great an honour as it conferred.  But
the Senatus recognised this fact, that his life all through
had been an educational training, equal at least to all the
learning of the schools.  A life of hard experience well
utilised has often achieved great results, as in Wauchope's
case it did.
</p>

<p>
But honours of this kind did not turn his head, or cause
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P166"></a>166}</span>
him to forget the commoner duties of life, or lessen his
interest in others.  He could and did sympathise with
distress and trouble, and even the brute creation were not
forgotten by him, as the following instance will show.
Lord Wolseley arrived in Edinburgh the day preceding
the graduation ceremony, and was the guest of General
Wauchope at Niddrie.  One evening the two officers were
taking a walk together round the grounds.  As they passed
the cottage door of one of his tenants, the man's daughter
was noticed to be leading a horse which was labouring
under a severe attack of inflammation.  Wauchope at once
stopped and inquired of the girl what was the matter, and
on being informed, the two commanders were soon as much
engrossed in the discussion of the poor animal's malady,
and the best remedy for it, as if it had been a question of
important military strategy.
</p>

<p>
One other event in civil life gave General Wauchope
in the summer of this year considerable notoriety.  On
the sudden death in June of Mr. Robert Cox, the member
for South Edinburgh, he was, at the urgent request of the
Unionist party, induced once more to enter the lists as
a candidate for parliamentary honours against Mr. Arthur
Dewar, advocate, who represented the Liberal party.
</p>

<p>
The contest was a short one, but while it lasted it was
sharp, for both the candidates and their supporters threw
themselves into it with vigour and earnestness.
</p>

<p>
As in his famous campaign against Mr. Gladstone, the
chief feature of the General's policy was the integrity of
the Empire, as opposed to the cry of Home Rule for
Ireland, and although other subjects formed a part of his
programme, still that was for him the root question of
all others at the time.
</p>

<p>
At a largely attended meeting of his supporters, held
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P167"></a>167}</span>
on the 9th June, Mr. John Harrison, the chairman, in
formally nominating him for the vacancy, spoke of the
name of Wauchope 'as one which stirred the blood
of every one who had any pride in his country.  He
was known wherever the English language was spoken.
Wherever the British went he was known as a gallant
soldier, who had done his duty to his country in many
climes and in many circumstances, as a soldier of the
Crown.  He was known in a narrower sphere all over
Scotland as an honourable politician, who fought some
years ago a good fight in Midlothian.  He fought an
uphill fight&mdash;what some considered an impossible fight&mdash;and
in losing it he scored a tremendous success.  But he
was also known as a good neighbour, whose ancestors
had resided at Niddrie for centuries back.'
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope's speeches at this and various other
meetings, held almost daily for the following two weeks,
were of a most stirring nature, but were always characterised
by courtesy towards opponents, and the utmost frankness
in stating his opinions.  He scorned to 'hedge' a question
to secure votes, and when challenged with being a Tory,
and therefore ineligible for a Liberal constituency, he boldly
took up the challenge.  'Mr. Dewar had said he was a Tory.
(A voice, "Quite right.")  Quite right.  Yes.  Mr. Dewar
was quite right.  He never said he was wrong.  He often
wondered why there should be any disgrace in being called
a Tory.  Who had done most for the working classes in days
gone by?  Who passed the Factory Acts?  Did Mr. Gladstone
or Mr. Bright pass the Factory Acts?  No; it was the
Tory party&mdash;that party which had been so much abused.'  At
another time, referring to free speech, he said: 'He
knew there were many in the hall opposed to him in
politics.  There was no use putting the blinkers on that
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P168"></a>168}</span>
fact; but he did not see why, though thus opposed,
they should not meet together as free citizens of a free
city, and have it out thoroughly.  He never liked to use
the word opponent.  He always said "political" opponent,
because he found that some of the best friends he had
were politically opposed to him.  He was pleased to think
that in this country more and more both sides were
coming together to discuss political affairs in a quiet and
proper manner.  It was not always so.  When he was
young, things were much hotter then.  There was more
powder in the air.'
</p>

<p>
In reference to our foreign policy, the General spoke
in the highest terms of Lord Salisbury's dealing with the
Soudan question, as compared with that of Mr. Gladstone's
Government, when divisions in the Liberal party had led
to so much loss of life and money without corresponding
results.  And in regard to the Transvaal question, then
beginning once more to attract public attention, he insisted
strongly that his great anxiety was that peace should
be preserved.  There was no man, he said, who was a
greater lover of peace than he was, but he deprecated the
vacillation and weakness and change of policy of 1881
that caused all the trouble then, and from which all the
present trouble had arisen.  What he wanted to see now
was a strong and firm line taken, and he believed matters
there would be put right.  It could not be to the advantage
of the Transvaal that British subjects should be treated
as they were being treated now.  What he wanted was that
their people should be treated as human beings, and have
the same voice in the government of the country as was
given them in any other civilised country.'  He admitted
that the Jameson Raid was a most unwise and wicked
proceeding, and had done a great deal to damage their
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P169"></a>169}</span>
relationship with the Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and
the Dutch portion of South Africa; 'but although that was
true, it did not remove the fact that the position of their
countrymen in the Transvaal had not been improved.  The
great mass of them had nothing to do with the Jameson
Raid.  They were British subjects, who went out there
under the <i>ægis</i> of the British Crown, and surely it was
their bounden duty as a nation to see that their rights
were respected.'
</p>

<p>
The poll was taken on 19th June, with the result that
Mr. Dewar, the Liberal candidate, was returned with a
majority of 831 over 4989 votes given for General
Wauchope.  The General in a manly speech at the close
assured his supporters 'they had no cause to be
discouraged, for they had only to gird up their loins, and
victory would one day rest with them.  He felt no bitterness
whatever in regard to this fight.  He was honoured
by their call, and they had told him he had not
dishonoured them.  They had fought a square fight on both
sides, and if he was right in his estimate of the citizens
of South Edinburgh, they would very soon put matters
right.  It was only the difference of 400 men going from
the one side to the other, and he would, so far as in
him lay, do his very utmost at any time to stand by and
aid them.'
</p>

<p>
It is due to Mr. Dewar to say that he looked upon the
General as 'a foeman worthy of his steel.'  In returning
thanks to his supporters, he frankly acknowledged that
'we have won a victory against the strongest and most
gallant opponent that could have been put in the field,
and I rejoice to say that the contest has been carried on
with the utmost courtesy and good feeling on both
sides.'  These words, spoken, as it were, in the very heat of the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P170"></a>170}</span>
controversy, were more than confirmed some six months
after, when the sad news of the General's death on the
battlefield reached Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
The annual meeting of the South Edinburgh Liberals&mdash;which
was intended to be of a social as well as business
character&mdash;was held on the evening of the 13th December,
the very day on which the news came; but instead of going
on with the programme of proceedings, it was resolved out
of respect for the General's memory only to go through with
the ordinary formal business and then adjourn, Mr. Dewar
remarking, 'that having regard to the sad intelligence just
received, it would be utterly out of place that anything in
the nature of a social evening should be held....
When he stood before them in that hall a few months
ago, he had told them he counted it an honour to be
opposed by a soldier so distinguished, and a man so
eminent and thoroughly respected as General Wauchope.
As the election proceeded, their regard for him increased
day by day, and now that he was dead he felt as if they
were in the very presence of death; ... and every one
would agree that the proper and respectful course to take
was to give their last tribute to a man who was a gallant
opponent of theirs, and who became their friend; and they
should place upon his grave a wreath of respect and
regard.'  The chairman, in seconding the proposal, said
'he had frequently come in contact with General Wauchope
at the election, and it was remarkable that during the
whole contest, however keen it was, their opponent never
uttered one single word he had cause to regret.  No
election,' he added, 'was ever fought with more good
feeling than the contest between Mr. Dewar and General
Wauchope.'  And as showing the entire accord of the
large meeting with what had been said, the audience in
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P171"></a>171}</span>
silence, and upstanding, signified their sympathy with the
resolution, and quietly dispersed.
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope's political contests were thus
characteristic of the man.  There was the set purpose, the
indomitable will; no shrinking from declaring what he
thought was the truth, but an ever dauntless standing up
for the right at any hazard, all combined with a modest
diffidence of his own personal merits, and the utmost
respect and courtesy for his opponents' opinions.  It has
been said, 'he makes no friend who never made a foe'; but
the General had a happy way of turning his political foes
into fast friends.
</p>

<p>
With him political opinion did not sever the ties of
friendship.  Personalities did not enter into his political
life.  He would hold his own tenaciously, and give blow
for blow in fair fight, but there it ended.  Meeting a
number of friends at the Church Offices, 22 Queen Street,
shortly after this election, who were sympathising with him
on his defeat, he cheerily replied, 'Oh, I don't think much
of a man if he can't take a beating.'

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Another and a more stirring field of action was in store
for General Wauchope.  In several of his election speeches
reference, as we have shown, was made to the question
then beginning to agitate the public mind, as to our
relationship with the Transvaal Republic.  It was not
thought, however, that the difficulty was of such a nature as
could not easily be overcome by diplomatic arrangement.
True, the correspondence between Mr. Chamberlain, the
Colonial Secretary, and the Transvaal Government had
been protracted, and had practically failed in securing any
concession in favour of foreign residents in the Transvaal;
but few realised how near we were to the verge of a war
which has proved one of the greatest and most calamitous
of the century.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
South Africa
</span>
</p>

<p>
It will be in the recollection of our readers that when in
1881 the Boers invaded Natal and gained the victories of
Laing's Nek and Majuba Hill, Sir Evelyn Wood had ranged
his forces for an extended attack upon them and was
ready for action; and notwithstanding that Sir Frederick,
now Lord Roberts, had reached South Africa with 10,000
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P173"></a>173}</span>
additional men, the Government of Mr. Gladstone
abandoned their position and hurriedly patched up a peace
with Mr. Kruger.  All accounts agree that the treaty or
'surrender' after Majuba was regarded by both whites
and blacks all over South Africa as an absolute capitulation.
It had at all events a most disastrous effect upon
British influence there.  From that date arose in the Boer
mind that most fatal ingredient of racial animosity,
contempt.  As Kruger afterwards said, 'he had once reckoned
with the British army,' and he felt he could safely do so
again.  The one idea apparently fixed in his mind and
growing every day was to get rid of his subordination to
the Queen, with a view, as the Transvaal grew in military
efficiency, to subvert her power in South Africa altogether,
and set up a Dutch Republic.
</p>

<p>
Owing partly to the poverty of the country until the
great influx of British and foreign colonists, generally
called 'Uitlanders,' and the development of the gold and
diamond mines after 1884-5, the politics of the Transvaal
created little or no attention in England till about 1895,
when Boer raids into Bechuanaland and elsewhere obliged
the British authorities on the spot to protect our Colonial
interests against their further advances.  But then came
the Jameson Raid at the very end of that year, which,
though universally condemned both by the British
Government and people as an infraction of international
law, was yet the outcome of deep-rooted discontent in
the Transvaal by the English and other settlers there.
The 'Raid' was the turning-point in recent Transvaal
history.  In the first place, it attracted the attention of
the whole civilised world, and placed the Transvaal, the
Uitlanders, and the relationship of Great Britain both to
the one and to the other in the full glare of day.  From
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P174"></a>174}</span>
the date of the raid the difficulties of the position were
more and more accentuated, and the designs of President
Kruger for entire independence were hastened to a
consummation.  By the Boer government the course of
justice was perverted, and the Chief-Justice was made
subordinate to the will of the Executive.  Owing to
insecurity to life and property, mine owners could scarcely
get a supply of labourers.  Kruger and his Hollanders
ran the country for their own benefit.  They taxed and
plundered the Uitlanders, while neglecting such matters as
roads, bridges, railways, sanitary and educational schemes,
but took care to arm the Boers while they fattened on
monopolies, and kept the Uitlanders from any share in the
government.  In short, the Transvaal was a Republic in
nothing but the name.  It was really a corrupt oligarchy, in
which a privileged minority made laws to suit themselves,
and put the whole burden of taxation on the shoulders of
a majority who were deprived of the franchise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Uitlander grievances
</span>
</p>

<p>
With a largely increased revenue, President Kruger
found he could now indulge his hostility to this country
and his long-cherished hopes of independence by providing
for a possible struggle.  As Lord Selborne said, 'the money
was used to turn the whole of the Boer population into
soldiers; it was used to stock the whole country with
millions of cartridges, to buy battery after battery of guns,
to buy rifles enough to arm every Boer four or five times
over, to build things previously unknown in South Africa,
namely, great fortresses in the middle of the country, at
Pretoria and at Johannesburg&mdash;such fortresses as were
not to be seen in England except to guard the public
dockyards, and such as could only be seen on the frontier
between France and Germany.'  The course of the war
has abundantly shown that these enormous preparations
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P175"></a>175}</span>
had been made in view of other than mere native aggression;
that, in fact, nothing less than the entire subversion
of British authority over our South African Colonies was
to be aimed at.
</p>

<p>
So intolerable had the oligarchy at Pretoria made the
position of the Uitlanders, that these at length petitioned
the Queen for some redress of their grievances.  This
document, signed by 40,000 persons, 21,000 of whom were
British subjects in the Transvaal, was handed to the British
Agent in Pretoria for transmission to the High
Commissioner, and was forwarded by Mr. Conyngham Greene in
the ordinary official course to the Government.
</p>

<p>
The petition showed that for many years discontent had
existed among the Uitlanders, who are mostly British
subjects.  The Uitlanders possessed most of the wealth
and intelligence in the country, and they had no voice
in its government.  In spite of the promises of the
Transvaal Government and the petitions addressed to
the President, there had been no practical reforms.  The
discontent culminated in the insurrection of 1895.  The
people then placed themselves in the hands of the High
Commissioner, and President Kruger promised reforms.
Since then their position had been worse.  Legislation
had been unfriendly.  The petition cited as examples the
Aliens' Immigration Act, withdrawn at the instance of the
British Government; the Press Law, giving the President
arbitrary powers; the Aliens' Expulsion Law, permitting
the expulsion of British subjects at the will of the
President without appeal to the High Court, while
burghers cannot be expelled, this being contrary to the
Convention.  The municipality granted to Johannesburg
was worthless.  It was entirely subject to the Government.
Half of the councillors are necessarily burghers, though the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P176"></a>176}</span>
burghers and Uitlanders number 1000 and 23,000
respectively.  The Government rejected the report of the
Industrial Commission, which was composed of its own
officials.  The High Court had been reduced to a condition
of subservience, the revenues of the country had been
diverted for the purpose of building forts at Pretoria and
Johannesburg in order to terrorise British subjects; the
police were exclusively burghers, ignorant and prejudiced,
and were a danger to the community; jurors were necessarily
burghers, and justice was impossible in cases where
a racial issue might be involved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Petition of the Uitlanders
</span>
</p>

<p>
The petition went on to state that indignation was finally
aroused by the murder of Edgar and the favouritism
displayed by the Public Prosecutor.  A petition to the Queen,
presented by 4000 British subjects, was rejected in
consequence of informalities.  For taking a leading part in
getting up the petition, Messrs. Dodd and Webb were
arrested under the Public Meetings Act, and were only
released on giving bail of £1000, five times the amount
required for the murderer of Edgar.  A meeting within a
closed place, permitted by law and sanctioned expressly by
the Government, was called by the South African League
on January 14.  This was broken up by an armed and
organised band of burghers and police in plain clothes led
by Government officials.  The police refused to interfere.
The behaviour of the British subjects was orderly.  They
did not retaliate, preferring to lay their grievances before
Her Majesty.  No arrests were made either of the officials
responsible or of the rioters.
</p>

<p>
The condition of the British subjects, the petition
concluded, was intolerable.  They were prevented by the
direct action of the Government from ventilating their
grievances; 'wherefore the petitioners pray Her Majesty
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P177"></a>177}</span>
to extend her protection to them, to cause an inquiry to be
held into their grievances, to secure the reform of abuses,
and to obtain substantial guarantees from the Transvaal
Government and a recognition of the petitioners' rights.'  This
important petition was accompanied by affidavits
substantiating the various allegations made in it.
</p>

<p>
To have refused a petition like this under the circumstances
which had arisen, would have been tantamount to
resigning the position of paramount power.  Negotiations
and conferences ensued, in the vain hope of adjusting
racial differences, under Boer domination.  They came to
nothing, and only proved that the Pretoria Government
were merely waiting their time to strike a blow which they
hoped would for ever terminate British authority in South
Africa.  The opportunity, they thought, had at length
come, and on Monday the 9th October an ultimatum of
the most insolent nature was presented to the British
Government, demanding not only the immediate withdrawal
of our troops on the borders of the Republic, but
that all reinforcements which had arrived since 1st June
should be removed from South Africa.  Not only so, but
that any of Her Majesty's troops now on the high seas
should not be landed in any part of our colonies!  To
these requirements an immediate answer in the affirmative
was demanded 'not later than 5 o'clock on Wednesday'!  No
more ridiculous message has been received by the
British Government for over one hundred years.  Her
Majesty's Government declined to discuss the conditions of
the ultimatum, but expressed regret that the Transvaal
Government should contemplate so extreme and so serious
a step as war.  The invasion of Natal by the Boers followed
at once, and the Orange Free State, though in no way
involved in the matter in dispute, gratuitously sided with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P178"></a>178}</span>
Pretoria Government, and an invasion of Cape Colony
was made later on chiefly by the Free Staters.  With great
boldness and, it must be said, with much military skill,
the Boer forces seized the passes, attacked the small
garrisons on the frontiers, and after several successes and
defeats they finally settled down to besiege Ladysmith in
Natal, and Kimberley and Mafeking in Cape Colony&mdash;sieges
which will be long memorable in the history of
British South Africa.
</p>

<p>
The war had only proceeded for about a week when
General Wauchope received a commission to command
the Third or Highland Brigade, forming part of the western
column under General Lord Methuen for the relief of
Kimberley and Mafeking.  This position was undoubtedly
the highest honour he had achieved, and its acquisition
afforded him the utmost satisfaction.  He was residing at
Niddrie at the time, and as soon as it became known that
he was ordered to the front, there was a general desire
among the miners and villagers that he should have a
suitable 'send-off,' and some arrangements had actually
been made for the occasion.  But time was short, and
besides, the General, always a modest man, shrank from
publicity where he would be the central figure, and he
would not consent to it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Embarkation for the Cape
</span>
</p>

<p>
This, however, did not prevent him saying farewell to
his old friends.  Amid all the bustle of preparation he
found time to call at the cottages of not a few in the
grounds and in the village, to shake hands with their
inmates before he left; not, it is said, without forebodings
that it was for the last time.  To a friend in Edinburgh
who, in saying 'good-bye,' expressed the hope that he
would soon be back again with fresh laurels, he replied
with a shake of the head, 'I don't half like the job we
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P179"></a>179}</span>
have got; we have a very hard nut to crack with these
Boers.'  On Sunday, the 8th October, the General and
Mrs. Wauchope attended as usual the service in New
Craighall Parish Church.  It forms a part of the parish
of Liberton, and the church was erected chiefly for the
large mining portion of the population at the east end of
the parish, in which the General took so much interest.  He
liked the simple, natural, artless form of the Presbyterian
service, and as his minister has since remarked, 'We know
how reverently and heartily he worshipped, and the pleasure
he had in hearing and in joining in the singing of the
old psalms and paraphrases, without any accompaniment.'  It
was his last quiet Sabbath in Scotland.  With a view to
avoid fuss he slipped away that evening by rail for London,
without some of his nearest friends knowing he was off,
to see to the embarkation of his brigade.
</p>

<p>
The Highland Brigade was made up of the Seaforth
Highlanders, the Second Battalion Royal Highlanders (or
Black Watch), and the Gordon Highlanders&mdash;three crack
Scotch regiments, which any man might have been proud
to command.  The two first embarked for South Africa
at Tilbury Fort on the 21st and 22nd October in the
transports <i>Mongolian</i> and <i>Orient</i> respectively, the total
equipment in the latter being about 1200 officers and
men, including staff of a cavalry brigade, medical corps,
etc.  These were followed a fortnight later by the Gordons
under Colonel Downman from Edinburgh, among the
citizens of which city officers and men had earned an
honoured name.
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope joined the transport <i>Aurania</i> at
Southampton on 23rd October, and some of his letters
written on the eve of embarkation are touching illustrations
of kindly interest in others, and specially in those
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P180"></a>180}</span>
dependent on him.  To his old friend and colonel in the
first Soudan Expedition, Colonel Bayly, he writes:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'MY DEAR OLD COLONEL,&mdash;Many thanks for your kind
and affectionate letter.  I wish you were going out in
charge of the brigade.  I shall sadly miss your wise
counsels.  Well, I will do my best; and this I know,
whether I succeed or fail, you will stick up for me.&mdash;Yours
ever, A. G. WAUCHOPE.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To Mr. Martin, the manager of the Niddrie Collieries,
he wrote as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
'SOUTHAMPTON, 23<i>rd October</i> 1899.
</p>

<p>
'I am just about to embark.  Please go and see Mrs. Wauchope
when she gets back.  She will act for me at all
times in my spirit.  I hope you understand about the
send-off.  I hate fuss.  Give my love to all my numerous
friends in the works.  I hope "Klondyke" [one of the
new workings] will prosper and flourish.  I hope the war
will soon be over.  Symons is a terrible loss.  He was one
of our best.  [General Symons fell at the battle of Glencoe
in Natal, 20th October.]  The British officer and soldier is
showing to the world that they are not behind their fathers
in the days of the Peninsula and Waterloo.  I hope all
may continue so to do, and then make it up with the Boers,
who really must be reasonable.  We have no grudge against
them, beyond that we cannot allow a Dutchman to be
worth three Scotsmen.&mdash;Ever yours, A. G. WAUCHOPE.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To his head gardener, Mr. Alexander, also dated from

we are just off....  Please convey to all our men

That amid all the bustle of preparing to embark he
should still have time for loving thoughts of Niddrie and
'the old folks at home,' and should at the last moment
take the trouble to write such kindly words, speaks
eloquently of the affection in his breast for all that he had
left behind in Scotland.

Enthusiastic reception
</span>
</p>

<p>
The <i>Aurania</i> took out with her the 1st Battalion of
Highland Light Infantry, and Wauchope was accompanied
by Captain Rennie of the Black Watch, as his <i>aide-de-camp</i>.
The Black Watch in another vessel reached Table Bay two
or three days after the General's arrival, and were at once
entrained for De-Aar by half-battalions, so that until he
joined them a week or two afterwards, the General had
had no opportunity of coming in touch with his old
regiment since his appointment to the division.  Major Duff,
who was with the Black Watch at De-Aar, speaks of their
meeting as a remarkable one.  'I went up,' he says, 'in
command of the leading half-battalion, and when the men
first saw the General, their reception of him was a most
truly enthusiastic one.  They cheered him over and over
again, and it reminded one of their send-off to him at
York, as they had not seen him since then.'
</p>

<p>
While the British Government were thus hurrying
forward troops to the seat of war with all despatch, weeks
of course elapsed before they could be in a position
to meet the invaders.
</p>

<p>
The Boers in strong force, and evidently well prepared,
had actively assumed the aggressive, and in consequence
of the unexpected declaration of war by Presidents Kruger
and Steyn, the northern part of Cape Colony bordering
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P182"></a>182}</span>
upon the Orange Free State was for a time practically
defenceless.  Taking advantage of this fact, the Boers
had advanced boldly across the frontier, attacking many
of our towns and villages, and formally annexing them to
the Free State.  The arrival of British troops at the Cape
in November to some extent arrested this invasion, and
as troops were poured into the Colony in quick succession,
Generals French, Gatacre, and Methuen found themselves
ultimately in a position to assume the offensive, their
communications and supplies being kept up by the three
lines of railway from Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, and
East London respectively.  The Highland Brigade,
originally destined for Natal, was stopped at Cape Town and
at once sent on to reinforce Lord Methuen in command
of the western division.  With his advanced base at
De-Aar, at the junction of the Port Elizabeth and Cape
Town railways, and striking north with what troops he had,
Methuen engaged and defeated a party of Boers near
Belmont on the 10th November.  Nine days after, he
had concentrated his troops on the Orange River, driving
the enemy before him, and on the 23rd November he
attacked and completely routed the enemy in the decisive
battle of Belmont.
</p>

<p>
After several skirmishes the battle of Modder River was
fought, in which the British encountered a Boer force of
11,000 men.  It lasted the whole of Tuesday the 28th
November, and was keenly contested; but in spite of the
bravery and superior position of the enemy, they were
compelled to withdraw, and Methuen formed his advanced camp
on the north side of the river.  After the Modder River fight
he rested his force until the 10th December, waiting for
the battalions of Wauchope's Highland Brigade, for the
great naval gun, and the howitzer battery, and for the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P183"></a>183}</span>
sorely needed cavalry.  The valiant Ninth Brigade,
composed of Yorkshire Light Infantry, 5th Northumberlands,
Loyal North Lancashires, Northamptonshires, 9th Lancers,
and Mounted Infantry, which had done such gallant work
in the previous battles, was now to be scattered, and in
some measure supplanted by the Argylls, Seaforths,
Gordons, Black Watch, and Highland Light Infantry of
the fresher brigade.
</p>

<p>
Having secured his position on the Modder River, Lord
Methuen found the way to Kimberley still barred by the
Boer army under General Cronje.  The enemy were
strongly intrenched among the rocks and precipices of
the hilly region, some four miles from the river, between
the railway on the west and the highroad to Kimberley on
the east, and commanded the position with their artillery.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
The Diamond City
</span>
</p>

<p>
Lord Methuen resolved upon making a frontal attack in
full force on this stronghold, so as to drive the Boers out and
clear the road to the Diamond City, now suffering acutely
the miseries of a siege.
</p>

<p>
Before making the attack, he resolved to shell the Boer
position with all his artillery and the great naval gun which
had been dragged up to a ridge overlooking the kopje
occupied by the enemy, at ranges varying between six
thousand and eight thousand yards.  The bombardment
while it lasted was a severe one.  An eye-witness of
the scene says: 'The shells tore through the air with
precisely the noise of an express train rushing at highest
speed, and when they burst they seemed to envelop an
acre of ground in heavy brown smoke, which lifted and
floated over the kopje as if it were a mass of pulverised
earth.  The noise of each discharge was like the bark of
a monster bulldog, and the bursting of each shell sounded
like the cough of a giant.'  It is believed that the lyddite
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P184"></a>184}</span>
shells fell among the Boers several times during the afternoon,
but it is doubtful if the damage done was sufficient to
cause them to shift their position.  The naval gun remained
on the ridge all night, and defined the extreme left of the
next day's battle-ground.  This ground extended from the
railway where the gun stood, across the veldt to the river
and along its northern bank for two miles, or about four
miles from the railway to near the Kimberley road.  It
was covered&mdash;ridges and level veldt alike&mdash;with bushes,
or shapely little trees from four to seven feet high, of
round, full form, and pretty dense foliage.  In such a
veldt as this the Boers had two miles of trenches in front
of their strongly fortified heights, well packed with
riflemen.  And not only so; but to make the approach more
difficult, lines of barbed-wire fencing were run across the
veldt parallel with the trenches.
</p>

<p>
To attack such a strong position required the very
best troops of the British army, if the assault were to be
a success, and Wauchope's Highland Brigade was selected
for the work.  Lord Methuen conceived it to be his duty
to take it at all hazards, seeing that his orders were to
relieve Kimberley, and the longer he remained inactive
on the Modder River, the probability was the enemy
would become stronger in front.  As soon therefore as
the last of his reinforcements arrived from De-Aar, he
resolved to attack the Magersfontein kopje.  For this
purpose, as we have said, the heights were bombarded
from 4.50 P.M. to 6.40 P.M. on the 10th December, in the
expectation that&mdash;judging from the moral effect produced
by his guns in the three previous actions, and the anticipated
effect of lyddite, to be used for the first time&mdash;there would
not only be great destruction of life in the trenches, but
a considerable demoralising effect on the enemy's nerves.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P185"></a>185}</span>
Whether this was so is doubtful.  A longer bombardment,
as the result proved, would in all probability have led
to a more successful issue of the enterprise, and with less
loss to our arms.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
On the eve of battle
</span>
</p>

<p>
General Wauchope having received his orders, all were
in readiness for the attack, which it was resolved should
be made in the darkness of the early morning.
</p>

<p>
Fireside romancers have pictured Wauchope on the
evening before the battle as full of despondency and
prepossessed with a sense of imminent disaster.  Needless to
say, these are purely imaginary fancies.  He was not the
man either to shirk danger or dread a deadly engagement.
</p>

<p>
What afterwards happened is best described in the words
of Lord Methuen's despatch.  'The night march,' he
says, 'was ordered for 12.30 A.M., the bearings and distance
having been ascertained at great personal risk by Major
Benson, Royal Artillery, my Deputy Assistant
Adjutant-General.  The distance is two and a half miles, and
daybreak was due at 3.25 A.M.  About half an hour after
the Highland Brigade marched off it came on to pour,
a heavy thunderstorm accompanying the rain.  The
downpour lasted until daybreak.  The brigade was led
with perfect accuracy to the point of assault by Major
Benson.  The advance was slow, even for a night march.
Major Benson, with a compass in each hand, having
frequently to halt on account of the lightning and rifles
affecting the compasses.  I may remark that two rifles
went off by accident before the march commenced, and
it is pretty clear that flashes from a lantern gave the enemy
timely notice of the march.
</p>

<p>
'Before moving off, Major-General Wauchope explained
all he intended to do, and the particular part each battalion
of his brigade was to play in the scheme.  The brigade
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P186"></a>186}</span>
was to march in mass of quarter columns, the four
battalions keeping touch and, if necessary, ropes were to
be used for the left guides; these ropes were taken, but
I believe used by only two battalions.  What happened
was as follows:&mdash;Not finding any signs of the enemy on
the right flank just before daybreak, which took place at
4 A.M., as the brigade was approaching the foot of the
kopje, Major-General Wauchope gave the order for the
Black Watch to extend, but to direct its advance on the
spur in front, the Seaforth Highlanders to prolong to
the left, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to prolong
to the right, the Highland Light Infantry in reserve.  Five
minutes earlier (the kopje looming in the distance) Major
Benson had asked Major-General Wauchope if he did not
consider it to be time to deploy.  Lieut.-Colonel
Hughes-Hallett states that the extension could have taken place
two hundred yards sooner, but the leading battalion got
thrown into confusion in the dark by a very thick bit of
bush about twenty or thirty yards long.  The Seaforth
Highlanders went round this bush to the right, and had
just got into its original position behind the Black Watch
when the order to extend was given by Major-General
Wauchope to the Black Watch.  The Seaforth Highlanders
and two companies of the Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders were also moving out, and were in the act of
extending, when suddenly a heavy fire was poured in by
the enemy, most of the bullets going over the men.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Magersfontein
</span>
</p>

<p>
'Lieut.-Colonel Hughes-Hallett at once ordered the
Seaforths to fix bayonets and charge the position.  The
officers commanding the other battalions acted in a
similar manner.  At this moment some one gave the
word "Retire."  Part of the Black Watch then rushed back
through the ranks of the Seaforths.  Lieut.-Colonel Hallett
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P187"></a>187}</span>
ordered his men to halt and lie down, and not to retire.
It was now becoming quite light, and some of the Black
Watch were a little in front, to the left of the Seaforths.
The artillery, advancing to the support of the attack, had
opened fire from the time it was light enough to see.  No
orders having been received by the Seaforths, the
commanding officer advanced the leading units to try and
reach the trenches, which were about four hundred yards
off; but the officers and half the men fell before a very
heavy fire, which opened as soon as the men moved.
About ten minutes later the Seaforths tried another rush,
with the same result.  Colonel Hughes-Hallett then
considered it best to remain where he was till orders came.
</p>

<p>
'Meanwhile the 9th Lancers, the 12th Lancers, G
Battery Royal Horse Artillery, and Mounted Infantry
were working on the right flank.  At twelve midnight on
the 10th the 12th Lancers and Guards marched from
camp, the former to join the Cavalry Brigade, the latter
to protect the rear and right of the Highland Brigade.
Considering the night, it does Major-General Sir Henry
Colville immense credit that he carried out his orders to
the letter, as did Major-General Babington.  A heavy
fire was maintained the whole morning.  The Guards
Brigade held a front of about one and three quarter
miles.  The Yorkshire Light Infantry protected my right
flank with five companies, three companies being left at
a drift.  Captain Jones, Royal Engineers, and Lieutenant
Grubb were with the Balloon Section, and gave me
valuable information during the day.  I learnt from this
source, at about twelve noon, that the enemy were
receiving large reinforcements from Abutsdam and from
Spytfontein.  The enemy held their own on this part
of the field, for the under-feature was strongly entrenched,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P188"></a>188}</span>
concealed by small bushes, and on slight undulations.
At twelve noon I ordered the battalion of Gordons, which
was with the Supply Column, to support the Highland
Brigade.  The trenches, even after the bombardment by
lyddite and shrapnel since daybreak, were too strongly
held to be cleared.  The Gordons advanced in separate
half-battalions, and though the attack could not be carried
home, the battalion did splendid work throughout the
day.
</p>

<p>
'At 1 P.M. the Seaforth Highlanders found themselves
exposed to a heavy crossfire, the enemy trying to get
round to the right.  The commanding officer brought his
left forward.  An order to "Retire" was given, and it
was at this time that the greater part of the casualties
occurred.  The retirement continued for five hundred
yards, and the Highlanders remained there till dusk.
Lieut-Colonel Downman, commanding the Gordons, gave
the order to retire, because he found his position
untenable, so soon as the Seaforth Highlanders made the turning
movement to the right.  This was an unfortunate
retirement, for Lieut.-Colonel Hughes-Hallett had received
instructions from me to remain in position until dusk,
and the enemy were at this time quitting the trenches by
tens and twenties.  I have made use of Lieut.-Colonel
Hughes-Hallett's report (the acting Brigadier) for the
description of the part the Highland Brigade took in
this action.
</p>

<p>
'Major-General Wauchope told me, when I asked him
the question, on the evening of the 10th, that he quite
understood his orders, and made no further remark.  He
died at the head of the brigade, in which his name will
always remain honoured and respected.  His high military
reputation and attainments disarm all criticism.  Every
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P189"></a>189}</span>
soldier in my division deplores the loss of a fine soldier
and a true comrade.  The attack failed; the inclement
weather was against success; the men in the Highland
Brigade were ready enough to rally, but the paucity of
officers and non-commissioned officers rendered this no
easy matter.  I attach no blame to this splendid brigade.
From noon until dark I held my own opposite to the
enemy's intrenchments.  G Battery Royal Horse Artillery
fired hard till dark, expending nearly two hundred rounds
per gun.  Nothing could exceed the conduct of the troops
from the time of the failure of the attack at daybreak.
There was not the slightest confusion, though the fight
was carried on under as hard conditions as one can
imagine, for the men had been on the move from midnight,
and were suffering terribly from thirst.  At 7.15
P.M. fighting ceased, the Highland Brigade formed up under
cover, the Guards Brigade held my front, the Yorkshire
Light Infantry secured my right flank, the cavalry and guns
were drawn in behind the cavalry.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An ill-fated enterprise
</span>
</p>

<p>
Many descriptions have been published of the ill-fated
enterprise, differing in some respects from the despatch
of the commander; and much controversy has been raised
as to an alleged difference of opinion between Generals
Methuen and Wauchope regarding the method of the
attack on the Boer position, and as to who was responsible
for its disastrous failure.  Into that controversy it is not
our purpose to enter, seeing so much of it is founded on
mere conjecture, coloured by the imagination or the
prejudice of some of the writers.  Whether blunder, or
miscalculation, or mere misadventure, no voice has been
ever raised to cast the shadow of blame on the officer
who gallantly led his brigade through that long dark
night into what proved an impossible position, a position
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P190"></a>190}</span>
which the best troops in the world could not have hoped
to take.  Every precaution was made that forethought
could suggest.  Untoward circumstances, and not want
of courage, ruined all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Fall of the General
</span>
</p>

<p>
That the fall of the General largely contributed to the
loss of the battle, seems all too plain.  He fell after being
twice hit with rifle bullets through his helmet, and even
while lying on the ground, when struck in the body, he
appears, from the evidence of some of his men who
passed him as they still pressed on to his orders, to be
able to raise himself on his hands and knees, and taking
a long farewell of his comrades, he cried, 'Good-bye, men;
fight for yourselves.  It is man to man now.'  Other words
are said to have been uttered, and were freely circulated
afterwards about the camp, and found their way into
letters written to friends at home; but in the din and
confusion of such a moment it is difficult to see how
these&mdash;many of them contradictory&mdash;can be accepted as his
utterances.  One witness describes the scene as 'an awful
sight.  The bullets,' he says, 'were like a shower of hail,
and the shells were bursting all around us.  God knows
how I got clear, for I was in the thick of it.  I felt the
heat of a shell on my face.  I never was so near being
killed in my life.  There were bullets hitting all around
me, and whistling over my head.  I have been in a few
battles, but nothing like this....  We would have beat
them had our General not been killed.  He was shot in
three places.'
</p>

<p>
That General Wauchope fought and fell as a man and
as a soldier, carrying out his orders loyally to the end, has
never been called in question.  He died where he would
have wished to die, at the head of his gallant Highlanders,
with his face to the foe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P191"></a>191}</span>
</p>

<p>
All that fateful day the battle was carried on.  Our
wounded and dead lay as they fell, under a blazing sun,
close to the Boer lines.  Over their heads the shots of
friends and foes passed, without ceasing.  'Many a gallant
deed was done by comrades helping comrades; men who
were shot through the body lay without water, enduring
all the agony of thirst caused by their wounds and the
blistering heat.  To them crawled Scots with shattered
limbs, sharing the last drop of water in their bottles, and
taking farewell messages to many a cottage home in far-off
Scotland.'  But still the battle raged.  Wounded and dead
must wait alike the ultimate fate of the day.  Lying on
the veldt the British still held their ground, firing when
they could, but drawing a hotter fire upon themselves from
the trenches.  For fourteen hours they thus lay&mdash;from
three o'clock in the morning till six at night.  It was cruel
work, with all the odds against the attackers, fighting
against a foe they could neither see nor reach.  Once the
Guards made a brilliant dash at the trenches, and like
a torrent their resistless valour bore down all before them,
and for a brief few moments they got within striking
distance of the enemy; and well did they avenge the slaughter
of the Scots.  With bayonets fixed and a ringing cheer
the Guardsmen, we are told by a graphic writer, 'tossed
the Boers out of their trenches as men in English
harvest-fields toss the hay.'  Then they retired under the deadly
fire from the heights above, falling thick as hail upon
them.
</p>

<p>
Not till the evening did the conflict cease.  Then there
was an armistice, and our ambulance bearers went out to
bring in their fallen comrades.  The Rev. J. Robertson,
chaplain of the brigade, mentions in a letter: 'I was with
Wauchope when he fell.  I think he wished me to keep
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P192"></a>192}</span>
near him, but I got knocked down, and in the dark and
wild confusion I was borne away, and did not see him in
life again, though I spared no effort to find him, in the
hope that he might be only wounded.'  This statement
is confirmed by the Anglican chaplain with Lord Methuen,
who, after describing the battle of Magersfontein, thus
refers to the Highland Brigade: 'Being chiefly Highlanders,
they were in Robertson's charge.  He, good-hearted fellow,
was risking his life in the trenches and under fire to find
General Wauchope's body.  Why he was not killed in
his fearless efforts I cannot tell.'  The General's body
was found next morning from twenty to thirty yards off
the Boer trenches, 'riddled with bullets,' and was carried
reverently back into camp, amidst the unmistakable grief
of every soldier.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
'Lochaber no more'
</span>
</p>

<p>
The exigencies of war brook no delay, and so the
funeral was arranged for the day following.  Three
hundred yards to the rear of the township of Modder
River, just as the sun was sinking in a blaze of African
splendour, on the evening of Tuesday the 13th December,
a long shallow grave lay exposed in the breast of the veldt.
To the westward the broad river fringed with trees ran
unconsciously along; to the eastward the heights still
held by the enemy scowled menacingly; north and south
stretched the long swelling plain.  A few paces to the
north of the grave, fifty dead Highlanders lay, dressed as
they had fallen.  They had followed their chief to the
field, and they were to follow him to the grave.  It was
an impressive sight, and as one who saw it has said: 'The
plaids dear to every Highland clan were represented
there, and, as I looked, out of the distance came the
sound of the pipes.  It was the General coming to join
his men.  There, right under the eyes of the enemy,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P193"></a>193}</span>
moved with slow and solemn tread all that remained of
the Highland Brigade.  In front of them walked the
chaplain, with bared head, dressed in his robes of office;
then came the pipers with their pipes, sixteen in all, wailing
out "Lochaber no More"; and behind them, with arms
reversed, moved the Highlanders, in all the regalia of
their regiments; and in the midst, the dead General, borne
by four of his comrades.'  Many a cheek was wet with
tears, and many a heart throbbed with emotion as the last
kind offices were performed.  Right up to the grave they
marched, then broke away into companies until the General
was laid in the shallow grave, with a Scottish square of
armed men around him.  The simple Presbyterian service
of the Scottish Church was led by Mr. Robertson, the
chaplain, amid profound silence.  No shots were fired.
Only the silent farewell salute of his sorrowing men as they
marched campwards in the gathering darkness, and the
black pall of an African night was drawn sadly over the
scene.

There, among his men, Wauchope's body might have
been left to rest on the open veldt, and the spot would
doubtless ever afterwards have been consecrated in the
heart of every patriot Briton, lonely and wild though
it be.  But the kindly sympathy of a brother Scot found
for him a last resting-place four hundred miles farther
south in Cape Colony, at Matjesfontein.  On receipt of
the news of Wauchope's death, the Honourable J. D. Logan,
a member of the Cape Legislative Council, who
owns an extensive estate there, on which there is a small
enclosed private burying-ground, promptly asked permission
to bring the body for reinterment there.  Permission
having been granted by General Lord Methuen, Mr. Logan
proceeded to Modder River, and returned with the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P194"></a>194}</span>
body in a zinc-lined coffin on the 18th December.  The
remains of the gallant General were buried next morning
with full military honours, in presence of a considerable
number of people.  Those present included Captain
Rennie, <i>A.-D.-C.</i> to the General, Mr. Logan and his
family, Major Stuart, and Colonel Schrembrucker.  The
escort consisted of eleven officers and 195 non-commissioned
officers and men of various detachments, including
some of the Highland Brigade, and a fife band with
pipers.  The coffin was borne on a gun-carriage, which
was covered with many beautiful wreaths, one bearing the
inscription, 'With the Logans' deepest sympathy.  In
memory of one of Scotland's brave ones.'  And on
another was inscribed, 'A token of admiration and respect
for one of Scotland's heroes, from his fellow-countrymen
at Matjesfontein.'  The favourite charger of the General
followed the coffin, and the service, conducted by the
Revs. Messrs. Robertson and Price, army chaplains, was
of a deeply impressive character.  Thus passed from
sight, at the age of fifty-four, the man whose career it
has been our privilege to sketch.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
After the battle
</span>
</p>

<p>
Few episodes in the Transvaal war&mdash;and there have
been many striking ones&mdash;have made such an impression
on the public at large, or on those immediately concerned,
as the fall of the leader of the Highland Brigade
on that disastrous 10th of December 1899.
</p>

<p>
The one man best qualified to speak of its effects upon
the soldiers at the front, has in touching letters referred to
the sadness that overspread the camp, and the deep
religious feelings which were awakened.  The
Rev. J. Robertson says: 'Of the seven who formed our original
mess&mdash;General Wauchope's brigade staff&mdash;only Colonel
Ewart and myself remain.  He is an old campaigning
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P195"></a>195}</span>
friend, so also is General Macdonald, who has now joined
us.  I am glad I knew the Brigadier before.  It makes all
the difference, messing and living together.  I am not to
refer to General Wauchope.  Mere acquaintances mourn
his loss, how much more one who was honoured with his
friendship and confidence?  As for the Highland Brigade&mdash;there
is but one heart, and it's sore, sore.  A strange
fatality befell all my best-known friends.  Whenever I let
myself think of them, there's a painful tug at my heart's
strings.  God knows what lies before.  To give some
idea of how hearts have been touched, on the last Sunday
of the year I had communion.  I thought it better to take
it then than on the first Sunday, when the year would be
a week old and the good start perhaps lost.  I did not
make intimation the Sunday before, as I did not think
I would be able to get communion wine in time.  I just
stated at the ordinary parade service that I purposed
having it after the benediction was pronounced.  I
invited any and every one to come forward, even though
they had not partaken it before, saying that in the
circumstances I took it upon me to dispense with the usual
preparatory forms of procedure.  To my great surprise, but
to my heart's joy, knowing how backward young men
are&mdash;Highlanders especially&mdash;in coming to the Lord's Table,
over 250 stepped out, and many more would have come
had it not been for the fact that they had to go at once
on picket duty.  In fact, they had strained a point to
attend parade service, coming all ready to go on outpost,
heavily accoutred.  With a full heart, I thanked God and
took courage.'  In another letter the chaplain says: 'We
were a sad, a very sad brigade, for though we tried to
hide it, we took our losses to heart sorely; for "men
of steel are men who feel."  But out of evil came good.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P196"></a>196}</span>
The depth of latent religious feeling that was evoked in
officers and men was a revelation to me, and were it not
that confessions, and acknowledgments, and vows are
too sacred for repetition, I could tell a tale that would
gladden your hearts&mdash;not that I put too much stress on
what's said or done at such an impressionable, solemnising
time, but after-proof of sincerity has not been wanting.'
</p>

<p>
The receipt of the news of the General's death in
England, Scotland, and Ireland, and indeed throughout
the world, was accompanied with every expression of grief.
It was felt that the empire had lost one of its noblest and
best, that a hero had gone down to his rest ere his full life's
work was done.  Alike from soldier and civilian, from political
opponent and political friend, came the common lament;
while the fluent pens of journalists were in some cases
constrained to acknowledge that it was all but impossible
to write with calmness of the sad event.
</p>

<p>
The national feeling was roused as it seldom has been
before, and from one correspondent we have the following
remarkable testimony.  'I believe,' he says, 'that General
Wauchope's tragic death did more than anything else to
bring the nation as a nation to call upon God.  No doubt
before his death there was much prayer throughout the
nation both in private and in almost all the churches; but
there was no national acknowledgment of God&mdash;no day set
apart by authority for this purpose.  General Wauchope's
death awoke the national conscience, and there was a public
recognition of God by the nation.  It is a matter of history
that when this took place the tide of battle, which for so
long had been against us, then began to turn in our favour.
Andrew Gilbert Wauchope did not die in vain.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Sympathy of the Queen
</span>
</p>

<p>
Her Majesty the Queen felt the loss she and the
country had sustained, and, with her usual womanly
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P197"></a>197}</span>
consideration, sent a message through her Lord Chamberlain,
the Earl of Hopetoun, desiring him to express her deep
sympathy with Mrs. Wauchope of Niddrie, and with Lady
Ventry, the General's sister.  In this message, it is
understood the Queen paid a warm tribute to the General's
fearless qualities as a soldier, and to his magnificent
services to the nation; while she sympathetically referred
to the fact, that in every campaign in which he had taken
a part previously, with the exception of the Soudan war of
1898, he had had the misfortune to be wounded.
</p>

<p>
Seldom has so general and so spontaneous an expression
of public feeling been given in this country.  In
Scotland especially was this so, as might naturally be
expected.  In Edinburgh, where both the Black Watch
and the Gordon Highlanders had recently been stationed,
the death of Colonel Downman of the Gordons, and many
others with him in the same engagement, gave a sharper
edge to the calamity.  Lieutenant F. G. Tail, also well
known in Edinburgh, and popular all over the country as
a champion golfer, was wounded on this occasion.  After
his recovery he went again to the front and was killed on
7th February at Koodoosberg Drift.  From Mr. Low's
record of his life it is interesting to quote what he says as
to the Black Watch at Magersfontein, inasmuch as it differs
somewhat from the despatch of Lord Methuen already
quoted, and expresses the opinion of one who was on the
spot.  'The papers say the Highland Brigade retired and
re-formed.  The Black Watch never did; and, furthermore,
we held our ground all day.'  As to his commanding
officer he says, 'General Wauchope is in no way responsible
for the fearful loss of life amongst the Highland Brigade:
he got his orders, and had to carry them out, and he was
killed in front of his brigade.'

CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p class="t3">
CHARACTERISTICS
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A devoted soldier
</span>
</p>

<p>
That General Wauchope was a skilled officer goes without
saying.  He had made military tactics his life study.  And
he had the personal influence that enabled men to follow
his leadership without hesitation.  Several of his brother
officers who had been with him for years, and had fought
beside him in many a battle, have favoured us with their
opinion of his skill as a commander; and, as to his
responsibility for the blunder or misadventure of Magersfontein,
one of them says: 'As a commanding officer, he was
beloved by all ranks; respected as a born leader of men,
for he had but to hold up his little finger and the
whole regiment would have followed him to&mdash;anywhere!
He brought the battalion to a wonderful pitch of
excellency, both in professional and social success, and
invariably received the highest praise from every general
officer who ever inspected them.'  And from another we
have the remarkable testimony: 'Wauchope diligently
studied his profession, to which he was devoted, and was
noted in his regiment for his coolness and judgment.  I
say this with special reference to the circumstances
preceding his lamentable death, and the loss of a large
part of the Highland Brigade recently in South Africa.
Eminently a cool and cautious leader, Wauchope would
have never led his brigade in close formation into the very
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P199"></a>199}</span>
jaws of destruction without scouting or other means of
discovering the near proximity of the enemy, unless he
had had direct stringent orders to do so.'  From still
another distinguished officer comes the following: 'General
Wauchope's name as a soldier was known to all ranks in
the army, and I am certain that time will prove that he
was not responsible for the decimation of the brigade he
loved so well.  He was far too good a tactician for that
blunder.'
</p>

<p>
It will be seen as our narrative has proceeded, that
while the career of Andrew Gilbert Wauchope of Niddrie
is in the main that of an earnest, devoted soldier of the
Crown, full of chequered incident and varied experience,
there is at the same time a many-sidedness of character
developed in his life.  A soldier first, he was as much at
home, it has been said, in the commonplace business
of the local School Board and Parish Council, or in the
transactions of the General Assembly of the Church of
Scotland.  Essentially a modest man, he never made an
affectation of superiority, and indeed he was much inclined
to underrate his own ability in almost every work in which
he was engaged.  As a politician he knew his own
mind, and he had become one of the clearest and most
humorous exponents of the policy which he advocated.
Great in arms, he was equally great in the arts of peace;
and while professionally attached to his duties as a soldier,
he had a horror of war, and an unbounded appreciation
of the blessings of peace.
</p>

<p>
Those who knew him best, who had lived with him
in barracks or camp, who shared with him the dangers of
war, bear witness to his many kind deeds, and his sympathetic
interest in others, of his kind-hearted generosity,
his homeliness, and general simplicity of heart.  He was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P200"></a>200}</span>
indeed a typical Scotsman, possessing all the best
characteristics of a Scotsman, with no fear in his heart but the
fear of God, or, as one has described him&mdash;'A man among
men, and a man of God.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
Honoured by all
</span>
</p>

<p>
To the people on his estate he was more than anything
else a father, in his interest and care; the active patron
of everything that was worthy, the participator in all that
was helpful to their life; the benefactor whose liberal
hand supplied many a need, and brightened and blessed
many a home.  When the news of his death came from
South Africa, all ranks and classes united in lamenting
the fall of a brave and a good man, of one who would
be much missed, of one who could ill be spared.  'From
the Queen on the throne to some of her humblest
subjects, through all ranks of statesmen and politicians
of all shades of opinion, from soldiers and from sailors of
all grades, and most affectionately from the rank and file
of his own historic regiment, from newspapers throughout
the length and breadth of the land, from neighbours and
friends&mdash;and who were not his friends who knew him?&mdash;even
from opponents; in short, from all classes, the highest
and the humblest, came tributes of respect and eulogy,
and expressions of sorrow over what seemed, at first
thought, his untimely end.'
</p>

<p>
As it has been well said, 'the simple record of his
campaigns and wounds, in the service of Queen and
country, would alone be sufficient to confer greatness on
any man.  His was the truest greatness, because he was so
utterly unconscious that it was great; and his extreme
modesty, and almost diffidence, obscured it from the
merely superficial observer.'
</p>

<p>
His was the kind of life that exerted a magnetic charm
upon all with whom he had dealings.  His plain exterior,
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P201"></a>201}</span>
his somewhat awkward gait and habiliments, more
frequently marked by the absence of fashionable
conventionality than by military smartness, were a deception to
a stranger.  'That the great Captain Wauchope!' said a
man on the road one day, when he was pointed out to
him as the hero of Tel-el-Kebir&mdash;'<i>That</i> Captain Wauchope,
impossible!  I thought that was a labourer!'  Though
carrying no outward symbol of what was in him, to his
friends he was dear.  But we do not always gather
diamonds on the surface.  ''Tis the mind that makes the
body rich.'  He seemed best to those who knew him
longest, for about his actions there was a sincerity that
was all the better because it was spontaneous; and behind
that bronzed, ascetic face&mdash;said by some to resemble
that of Cicero or Cæsar&mdash;there was a soul with the
courage of a hero and the tenderness of a woman.
</p>

<p>
In a letter from Dr. Wisely of Malta, we have striking
testimony in confirmation of this.  'Wauchope,' he says,
'in a remarkable manner fulfilled the New Testament
injunction to "honour all men," and this, I believe, was
the secret of his being honoured by all, for he was liked
and trusted by all sorts and conditions of men.  His
brother officers found in him a friend, and so did the
men in the ranks.  If any man had a grievance he was
sure of getting a fair hearing from him.  But Wauchope
was not easily taken in.  I remember seeing him once
standing in the street when I was speaking to a man of
his regiment, who had seen better days.  After the man
had left me, he came up and said, "I was just waiting to
warn you, lest you should be taken in by that man.  He
will tell you plausible stories to get money out of you,
but don't listen to him.  He is a humbug, and is not to be
trusted."  I found he was right.  But when there was
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P202"></a>202}</span>
real distress, Wauchope was ever ready to do what he
could to relieve it, and he did it in the most unostentatious
way.  In 1878, when he went with his regiment to Cyprus,
a man in his company, whom I knew, died of heat apoplexy
on landing.  Wauchope immediately wrote to me and
enclosed a cheque for £10, to be given to the man's
widow to help her, as he said, to make a fresh start.
I happened to mention this incident recently to a lady,
whose husband at one time commanded the regiment, and
she said "it was just like Wauchope," and that she knew of
many similar cases where his help was as quietly given.
On one occasion, when the regiment was in Egypt, he
presented a cheque for £200, to be expended, he informed
me, for the benefit of the women of the regiment, on the
one sole condition that his name should not be mentioned.
He had his own way, however, of dispensing charity, and
was not afraid to refuse to subscribe to objects merely
because other people subscribed and thought he ought
to do so too.  He judged for himself.  And he did so,
not only regarding cases of charity, but in whatever he
had to do with.  Some years ago we happened to be
speaking of his tenants in Scotland, and he told me that
he made a point of occasionally seeing each one alone,
without a factor or any one being present, and he would
ask the tenant to speak frankly to him, and let him know
of any grievance he had to complain of.  He did not
promise to agree with him, or to see things in the same
light, but he promised to give the case a fair hearing, and
to do his best to remedy the grievance, if he was convinced
that there was one.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A religious life
</span>
</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to discern that the secret spring
of such a life is to be found not so much in early
education, social influences, rank, ample means, or even
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P203"></a>203}</span>
natural kind-heartedness&mdash;though these doubtless had a
certain influence in the formation of character&mdash;as in that
fervent, devout spirit which characterised nearly all that
he said or did&mdash;in short, from that 'fear of the Lord which
is the beginning of wisdom.'  Wauchope's life was indeed
a deeply religious life.  Not religious certainly in the
conventional sense of the term, that looks to the repetition of
favourite texts of Scripture and the recurrence of pious
sentiments; but in the deep-down utterances of a devout heart
that sought the expression of his faith rather in deeds of
kindness and thoughtful sympathy.  His whole life, as we
have seen, was saturated with affection for those in life's
path who were bound to him by kindred ties, and for whom
his quick eye saw his help was needed.  Yet, let it be said,
he shrank from no opportunity which presented itself
of making a good confession before men, or of giving
religious comfort, or engaging in religious services, where
he might be able to do good.  His daily duties, he once
remarked to a company of Sabbath-school boys, were largely
influenced by his morning devotions.  The early training
of a Scottish home, with a pious father's example, laid the
foundation of a religious life, which after-trouble and
affliction more fully developed into ripe conviction, and
matured Christian faith.  He believed in prayer and in
family worship, and it was doubtless this that so much
imbued him with strength and courage for many a day of
arduous work and patient pain.  How else can we explain
that trying period of his life when in Malta, with a
drawn sword, as it were, hanging over his head, and
only a step between him and death?  There he sought
to know of the doctrine whether it be of God, and with
reverent fear put himself into his Saviour's hands, with the
desire to do God's will in every duty that fell to him.  'He
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P204"></a>204}</span>
followed on to know the Lord,' says Dr. Wisely of Malta,
'and he came to know the truth of the Gospel, not only as
a truth of faith, but a truth of personal experience.'
</p>

<p>
How else can we explain that impressive scene at the
grave in Cyprus shortly afterwards, when in the absence
of the chaplain he stepped forward, and in the midst of
his hushed and weeping comrades, touchingly performed
the last offices over the dead?
</p>

<p>
All through his life it was the same.  Consistent and
true, but without affectation, in his relationship to God
and to man, he sought to have a conscience void of
offence, and to do his duty as in view of the Eternal.

</p>

<p>
Fearless of death, and accustomed to meet it on many
occasions, he dreaded it the less that he fully realised the
after-issues.  It has been well said that the man who has
no place for death in his philosophy has not learned to
live.  The lesson of life is death.  For Wauchope, death
had no terrors, because it had been overcome through
faith in Him who has conquered death and the grave.
The pathos of life was with him no forced sentiment, for he
had often felt the pity for suffering and bereavement which
underlies all true life.  In his own family and person he
had experienced the loss of loved ones, and known the
grief and disappointments of a bereaved father.  Such
experiences broaden out sympathy and cause 'the primal
duties shine aloft like stars.'  In his own parish of
Liberton he discharged the office of the eldership with
much acceptance, visiting among the parishioners, and
officiating at the communion in the parish church; leading
a quiet, useful, unobtrusive life, doing good where he
had opportunity.  On several occasions a representative
elder in the highest court of the Scottish Church, he took
an active part in the work of the General Assembly.
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P205"></a>205}</span>
There indeed he was a prominent figure, as he would
sometimes take his seat in his military uniform fresh from
his duties as the officer commanding the Black Watch at
the Castle.  The Church of Scotland had no more true
and loyal son, and in many ways he identified himself
with her interests, and was always ready to testify to the
value of the national recognition of religion.  He was for
some time vice-convener of the Church's Committee on
Temperance, and had he been spared longer, his ripe
judgment, his knowledge of men, and his own personal
experience would doubtless have been of much service in
the advancement of this important cause.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
An elder of the Church
</span>
</p>

<p>
In 1895 he was chosen as one of the deputies by the
Assembly to represent the Church of Scotland at the
General Assembly of the Irish Presbyterian Church, which
met in Belfast in June of that year.  In introducing him
to the Assembly, the Rev. Professor Todd Martin, the
Moderator, paid a high tribute to his abilities as a soldier,
and spoke of the courage and bravery with which he had
faced the Right Honourable W. E. Gladstone, the greatest
political general of the age.  'Colonel Wauchope,' he
said, 'had won for himself the admiration and love of his
most strenuous opponents.  They honoured him, however,
specially because he took his place from year to year as a
ruling elder of the Presbyterian Church, and entered with
great enthusiasm into the maintenance of their Presbyterian
faith, to the advocacy of the simplicity of ritual, and
to the furtherance of temperance and every other good
cause that was for the salvation of the great body of the
people.'  Wauchope's address, which, according to the
prints of the day, was 'long, eloquent, and deeply interesting,'
feelingly referred at the outset to his Irish connection
through his mother; and after pointing out the
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P206"></a>206}</span>
dangers surrounding the Protestant population of Scotland
and Ireland, and the necessity for more united sympathy
for each other, he concluded as follows:&mdash;'I thank you,
Moderator of this vast Assembly, for the kind manner in
which you have been pleased to receive me as a member
of the Church of Scotland.  I am proud, and I cannot say
how proud, to be a member of it.  It is also a matter of
great thankfulness to all of us, especially to us laymen,
that now in the Church of Scotland we have elders&mdash;men
of great transcendent ability&mdash;who love their Church, and
work loyally as Christian men for the furtherance of that
great Church.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="sidenote">
A Christian gentleman
</span>
</p>

<p>
He had a high ideal of the Church's duty, and so far at
least as in him lay he sought to take his share of that
duty.  In the cause of temperance he had done much
among his soldiers, and in the Assembly he was ever the
eloquent advocate of its claims upon the attention of the
Church.
</p>

<p>
To one like him, more accustomed to the political
platform and the style of address there required than to the
ecclesiastical forms of the Church, it was natural he should
sometimes forget the ceremonial style peculiar to the
General Assembly.  On one occasion he rose to second
a motion, and inadvertently addressed the venerable
Assembly not as 'Fathers and Brethren,' but as 'Gentlemen,'
which immediately caused a titter to pass over the
House.  He at once became conscious of his mistake,
and turning to the chair, said, 'Moderator, I am no
theologian, nor am I an ecclesiastic; I am a soldier; I
second the motion.'  The brevity and pointed nature of
this short speech drew out an appreciative cheer, and the
motion was carried <i>nem. con</i>.
</p>

<p>
Though loving and serving his own Church faithfully
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P207"></a>207}</span>
and well, General Wauchope was no sectarian.  He had
seen too much of the world not to take a wide view
of the brotherhood of Christianity.  As the different
regiments of one army serving a common cause, he
viewed the various sections of the Church of Christ&mdash;whether
Roman Catholic or Protestant, whether Established
Church or Nonconformist, whether Episcopal or
Presbyterian&mdash;as all members one with another of the
great army of which the Lord Jesus Christ is the one
Captain and Head.  He could, and often did, extend a
helping hand to one and all as he had opportunity.
'Wherever I am wanted, I shall be there, straight,' was
his prompt and witty reply once to a 'heckler' at one
of his political meetings, when asked how it was possible
for him to serve both in Parliament and in the army.
The same answer might have been given as to church
and philanthropic demands made upon his sympathy.
'Wherever he was wanted' to advance any good object,
he was ready to be 'there, straight.'
</p>

<p>
The spontaneous references made after his death from
nearly every pulpit in Midlothian, and in various churches
in England and Scotland&mdash;too numerous to quote&mdash;and
the more formal deliverance of the General Assembly in
May 1900, all bear testimony to the nation's grief over the
loss of one who could ill be spared.  These expressions
may be found fittingly summarised in the words of one
who knew the General well, and who was accustomed to
experience his influence in his own parish of Liberton.
The Rev. George Dodds, of the Free Church there, in
concluding a memorial service in his church, and taking
as his text 2 Samuel i. 25&mdash;'How are the mighty fallen in
the midst of the battle!  O Jonathan, slain in thine high
places,' spoke as follows:&mdash;'Nothing which has hitherto
<span class="pagenum">{<a id="P208"></a>208}</span>
occurred,' he said, 'and perhaps no casualty which can
yet happen, could to any greater extent quicken our
imagination to realise the horrors of war, and the desperate
work these brave men face who fight our battles.  The
people of this parish will always remember the battle of
Magersfontein as that which deprived them of one of
whom they were more than proud.  General Wauchope
was a man whom every one loved, and it was little wonder.
Anything else was impossible.  A man so real, with no
vestige of the actor about him; so free from narrowness
both in church and political creed; so generous as a
patron, so philanthropic as a gentleman among his people;
so honourable as a public man, so brotherly as a
neighbour&mdash;when shall we look upon his like again? ... Liberton
parish knows what the army and the empire have lost, but
our loss is one of those sacred things with which no
outsider can intermeddle....  Much which I could tell
of him makes me know with undying conviction that
Andrew Gilbert Wauchope of Niddrie was one of the
finest Christian gentlemen one could find in a lifetime.'

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
