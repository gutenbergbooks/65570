</div>

<p>This volume represents substantially the FitzPatrick
Lectures which I had the privilege of delivering at the Royal
College of Physicians in 1912. Originally I intended to do
no more than gather together into a succinct record the
various memorials and reminders of Pestilence that I had
met with in my wanderings at home and abroad and in my
casual incursions into general literature. Insensibly the desire
to understand supplanted the desire merely to record, and the
desire to explain superseded the endeavour to understand.
I have turned my attention, as far as practicable, only to the
literary and artistic associations of Pestilence, but these
have inevitably overlapped the confines of history and of
medical science. The latter territory has been invaded only
so far as was necessary to ensure a correct orientation to the
inquiry. I have thought it wise to let the curtain fall at the
end of the eighteenth century, leaving it to my readers to
decide what vestiges of the mentality of distant centuries
have survived into this twentieth. A little reflection on this
will afford a most salutary lesson to all of us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

</div>

<p>The scattered records of literature afford a valuable, but
neglected, contribution to the study of epidemic pestilence.
They show us pestilence as an affair of the mind, as medical
literature has shown it as an affair of the body. They
teach us too the humiliating lesson that, in spite of the
progress of civilization, in spite of the apparent growth of
humanity, in spite of the development and dissemination
of scientific knowledge, human nature has again and again
reverted to the primitive instincts of savagery in face of
the crushing calamity of epidemic pestilence. The superficial
student of psychology may find it difficult to believe
that, so late as 1630 in Milan, so late as 1656 in Naples, so
late as 1771 in Moscow, the blood-lust of a maddened populace
sought and found a sedative in an orgy of human sacrifice.
But so it was. And in this homing instinct of the human
mind is to be found the clue to much in the records of
literature and art that else is wholly meaningless. It is
a grim chapter of history that lies before us, but maybe we
shall find here and there some spiritual Bethel reared out
of the hard stones on which suffering humanity has lain its
weary head.</p>

<p>The mind of primitive man conceives no power over nature
higher than his own: so is his attitude conditioned to disease.
He sees in disease only some evil magic, exercised by man
on man. The Australian native believes that the assailant
transmits disease by pointing some object at his victim,
who in turn looks to magic to free him from the disease.
In the New Hebrides the idea still persists that the aggressor
shoots some charmed material at the victim by means of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
bow and arrow. Medicine has not yet emerged from magic.’
The human mind, as it passes to higher stages of enlightenment,
does not wholly discard its primitive beliefs: of this
we find abundant testimony in early records of pestilence.
In Pharaoh’s plagues mark the importance of the manual
acts, the stretching out of the rod, the smiting of the dust,
the sprinkling of ashes. Again, when the Philistines of
Ashdod ask for deliverance from plague, the diviners enjoin
them to make images of their emerods, or swellings. This
is crude magic—imitative magic—the essence of which is
that any effect may be produced by imitating it. It is the
spirit in which a savage sprinkles water when he wishes rain
to fall.</p>

<p>As his own impotence is borne in on man, he comes to
look beyond himself alike for the cause and cure of his disease;
but human agency still bounds his whole horizon. He
looks to those likest himself in nature, the imperishable
spirits of his own departed dead. Endued with bodily
form, their ghosts need offerings of food and drink, and
humble homage of prayer. Neglect of these is recompensed
by the sending of sickness and death. This cult prevailed
in the religion of young Rome and in the Greek worship of
beings of the underworld (χθόνιοι), and may be found
to-day in Oceania. Such a deified spirit of the dead might
exert his influence in dreams to those who slept over his
abode. Such is the germ of the incubation ritual of the
demigod Asclepius, who revealed remedies for sickness, and
was invoked for deliverance from pestilence. Strabo says
that Tricca in Thessaly was the oldest sanctuary of Asclepius,
who was the deified ancestor of the Phlegyae and Minyae,
the ruling family of Tricca.</p>

<p>With the emergence of the idea of a separable soul came
the belief in its assumption after death of animal forms, and
chief of these the mysterious earth-dwelling serpent, darting
pestilence from his barbed tongue. The association of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
serpent with disease and pestilence is wellnigh world-wide.
The Vedas teem with it: classical and Christian literature
and art are full of it. We find it in Ovid,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in Gregory of
Tours,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in Paul the Deacon,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in many other writers.
The Book of Numbers too (xxi. 6 seq.) retains this imagery
of pestilence: ‘And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the
people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel
died. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We
have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against
thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents
from us. And Moses prayed for the people. And the
Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that
is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses
made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came
to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he
beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.’ Imitative magic—the
healing of like by like—is still the weapon with which
Moses counters the pestilence.</p>

<p>In Fernando Po,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> when an epidemic breaks out among
children, it is customary to set up a serpent’s skin on a pole
in the middle of the public square, and the mothers bring
their infants to touch it. In Madagascar, Sibree<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> found that
Ramahavaly, the god of healing, was also the patron of
serpents, and was able to employ them as agents of his anger.
In many parts of India also it is customary to make a serpent
of clay or metal, and offer sacrifices to it on behalf of the
sufferer.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Apollonius of Tyana also is said to have freed
Antioch from scorpions by making a bronze image of
a scorpion and burying it under a small pillar in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of the city. So the serpent has power not only to excite
pestilence, but also to avert it.</p>

<p>From these spirits of the nether world, human or animal
in form, it is a short passage to the conception of supernatural
beings above the earth, but still in human shape and still
with human attributes. Such are Apollo, Asclepius, and
Rudra. Traces of the evolution of these deities are usually
to be found in the attributes with which they are endowed
in later literature and art. The usual symbol of Asclepius
is a serpent coiled round a staff. Sacred snakes were kept
in his temples,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and applicants for healing fed them with
cakes.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Cures were frequently effected in the sanctuaries
of Asclepius by serpents stealing out and licking the wounds
of patients. The god-man finally supersedes the serpent,
but conservative religious sentiment retains the older
object of worship as the symbol and associate of the new.
In Greek legend it is the serpent from which Asclepius learns
the art of healing: true, Homer makes Chiron his teacher.
Numerous other legends of the serpent origin of medicine
survive. Polyindus the seer is said to have learnt the herbs
that can restore men to life by observing how the serpents
raised their dead to life. In Cashmere<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the descendants of
the Naga (serpent) tribes attribute their special skill in
healing to knowledge bestowed on their ancestors by
serpents: and the Celts acquired their medical lore from
drinking serpent broth. As with Asclepius, so also we shall
see with Apollo. Apollo in very truth slays the man-killing
Python, and himself becomes also the sender of pestilence.
He not only smites with disease the doer of evil, but wards
it off from the upright. His are the arrows that scatter
plague: but he is also the best of physicians. Such is the
Apollo of the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>

<p>Homer’s picture of the Archer Apollo has inspired one
at least of the masterpieces of Graeco-Roman sculpture.
Apollo the Avenger sends the pestilence in punishment of
sin. Homer sets it as a signal evidence of divine displeasure
in the forefront of his epic, as does Sophocles after him in
the greatest of his tragedies. Apollo is pictured as the god
who spreads the plague by arrows shot from his bow. He
swoops down with impetuous onset, like the sudden fall of
night in Mediterranean lands, as the ‘pestilence that
walketh in darkness’ and ‘the arrow that flieth by day’.
The plague is first epizootic, falling on mules and dogs,
then epidemic among the Greek host. A council is called,
and Achilles advises that some prophet or priest be summoned
to say what propitiatory sacrifices have been neglected:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">The seer Calchas shows them that it is sent rather as
a punishment for flagrant sin, the sin of Agamemnon in
carrying off Chryseis. It is for no neglect of honorific
sacrifices nor for neglected prayers that pestilence has come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
upon them. Chryseis must be sent back, and expiation be
made to Apollo with sacrifices, after the whole host has
been purified in the doubly cleansing water of the sea. So
Chryseis is sent back and</p>

<p class="noindent">Thus they offer the sacrifice of atonement for sin, with
the ablutions meet for a solemn lustration of the people.
Then when the plague is stayed, and not till then, may they
join in the glad eucharistic feast of meat-offerings and libations
of red wine, the whole assemblage taking it in company
with the god, crowning the cups with flowers and chanting
hymns of praise.</p>

<p>The Apollo of the <i>Iliad</i>, like the serpent of old, is not only
the sender but also the averter of pestilence.</p>

<p>Homer’s plague marks a stage at which prayer and sacrifice
have displaced magic in the struggle with pestilence. From
this time on the study of pestilence is inextricably blended
with that of the evolution of religion. Prayer and sacrifice
follow inevitably from the conception of the majestic man-god.
He must be approached on bended knee with request
for help: his is by right the homage of prayer. His worshipper
approaches him as he would an earthly potentate: he
cleanses himself, he begs for grace in humble posture, he
gives him of his best. Hence arise purification, prayer, and
sacrifice. At first, as in Homer, it is the body that is purified:
the offering of a clean heart and a right spirit is of later
growth. So long as the god is humanly conceived, food and
drink will be the meet offerings of sacrifice. Later with the
conception of a god dwelling aloft, as in the Homeric verse,
the sweet savour of the sacrifice, or of the scented smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
of incense rising to heaven, will find peculiar favour in his
sight. Primitive sacrifice is essentially social: it is a banquet
in which the worshippers join in communion with the god:
it is the true parent of the <i>lectisternium</i>. Early religion has
no doubts of the god’s good-will, if duly solicited: hence
the joyousness of dance and song attendant on the eucharistic
feast, the worshippers being convinced that the sacrifice has
restored them to the favour of the god. The stern god, the
God of the Old Testament, slow to forgive, has no place in
primitive theology. Hymns, such as the Greek warriors
sang in jubilant unison to Apollo, are the first dim gropings
of language into the domains of literature. Paeans of this
kind were chanted in the sanctuaries of Asclepius after
successful acts of healing.</p>

<p>In early Indian myth Rudra is the god who lets fly the
arrows of pestilence. Read this prayer to Rudra from the
<i>Atharvaveda</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>: there are many like it in the older <i>Rig-Veda</i>,
which reached near its present form as early as 1500 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><i>Prayer to Bhava<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and Sava<a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> for protection from dangers.</i></p>

<p>1. O Bhava and Sava, be merciful, do not attack us:
ye lords of beings, lords of cattle, reverence be to you
twain! Discharge not your arrow even after it has been laid
(on the bow) and has been drawn! Destroy not our bipeds
and our quadrupeds.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>7. May we not conflict with Rudra, the archer with the
dark crest, the thousand-eyed powerful one, the slayer
of Ardhaka!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>12. Thou, O crested god, earnest in (thy hand) that smites
thousands, a yellow golden bow that slays hundreds:
Rudra’s arrow, the missile of the gods, flies abroad:
reverence be to it, in whatever direction from here (it flies).</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>19. Do not hurl at us thy club, thy divine bolt: be not
incensed at us, O lord of cattle! Shake over some other

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>26. Do not, O Rudra, contaminate us with fever, or with
poison, or with heavenly fire: cause this lightning to descend
elsewhere than upon us!</p>

</div>

<p>Other gods than Rudra can stem the pestilence. ‘Vayu
[the wind] shall bend the points of the enemies’ bows, Indra
shall break their arms, so that they shall be unable to lay on
their arrows: Aditya [the sun] shall send their missiles
astray, and Krandramas [the moon] shall bar the way of
the enemy that has not started.’<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Like the Madonna of the
Christian Church Aditya staves off the arrows of pestilence.
The Aryan warrior certainly, the primitive Greek probably,
used poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>The language of the 91st Psalm reveals the same imagery
as do the Homeric epic and the Vedic hymns.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my
stronghold: my God, in him will I trust. For he shall
deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from the
noisome pestilence. He shall defend thee under his wings,
and thou shalt be safe under his feathers: his faithfulness
and truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not
be afraid for any terror by night: nor for the arrow that
flieth by day: For the pestilence that walketh in darkness:
nor for the sickness that destroyeth in the noonday. A
thousand shall fall beside thee, and ten thousand at thy
right hand: but it shall not come nigh thee.’</p>

</div>

<p>The arrows of pestilence have sunk deep into the tissue
of many languages. Practically all the Hebrew words for
plague (<i>Maggefah</i>, <i>Negef</i>, <i>Naga</i>, <i>Makkah</i>) indicate a blow.
Our English ‘plague’ is derived through the Latin <i>plaga</i>
from the Greek πληγή, a blow: so too the German <i>plage</i>.
The French <i>fléau</i>—a flail or a plague—embodies the same
idea of a blow, and is derived from the Latin <i>flagellum</i> and
the Greek θλίβω. To-day even physicians must needs
call the poisons of pestilence ‘toxines’, as though they
were arrow-poisons discharged from a bow (τόξον from
τυγχάνω = I hit). The Arabians speak of being ‘stung’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
or ‘pricked’ with plague, recalling respectively the serpents
and the arrows of pestilence.</p>

<p>Passing allusion has been made above to the plagues of
Pharaoh: it remains only to be said that there is now pretty
general agreement that these ten plagues represent merely
the seasonal variations, to which Egypt is peculiarly liable,
magnified in Jewish oral tradition. Perhaps the last plague,
the death of the firstborn, at the April of the exodus
(<i>circa</i> 1220 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>) may have been a true <i>pestis puerorum</i>,
falling with chief severity on those who lacked the immunity
afforded by a previous epidemic. It was the incursion of
Libyans and of the nations of the Greek seas into Egypt,
at least as much as the Biblical plagues, that enabled the
Israelitish serfs to make good their escape.</p>

<p>During the period of wandering in the wilderness Korah,
Dathan, and Abiram revolted against the ascendancy of
Moses and Aaron, and God caused them to be swallowed up
with all their households by an earthquake. Some of the
children of Israel murmured against their fate. Those that
did so were visited with a plague, that carried off 14,700
persons. The plague was stayed by Aaron offering incense
as an atonement on the altar—sacrifice still, but the sacrifice
only of a sweet savour to a God dwelling in heaven. The
juxtaposition, if it be not permissible to say the association,
of earthquake and pestilence in this narrative is noteworthy,
in view of the widespread belief in their causal relationship,
in later times.</p>

<p>All through the Old Testament plague is regarded, as
here, as a direct consequence of God’s anger. In the New
Testament it figures but little, and then rather as corrective
than punitive. The God of the Old Testament is a God
of vengeance: only in the later Prophets do we find even
a foreshadowing of the God of love and forgiveness, the
God of the New Testament. In portraying pestilence Art
has retained this conception of God as a stern punisher of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
wrongdoing, but in the personality of Christ, approached
through the mediation of the Madonna and Saints, has
recognized the New Testament conception of God.</p>

<p>The entrance into Canaan was the beginning to the Israelites
of a long period of warfare with surrounding tribes. At
last, in the pitched battle of Eben-ezer, the Philistines crushed
the army of Israel, captured the ark of the covenant, and
carried it off to Ashdod, where they placed it in the temple
of their own national god, Dagon. On two successive nights
the image of Dagon was mysteriously thrown down from
its pedestal. ‘The hand of the Lord was heavy upon them
of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with
emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.’ The men of
Ashdod made haste to send away the ark to Gath, another
Philistine city, but here, too, God ‘smote the men of the city,
both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret
parts’. From Gath it was sent to Ekron with like result:
‘for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city;
the hand of God was very heavy there. And the men that
died not were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the
city went up to heaven.’ After seven months of pestilence,
the Philistines called for the priests and diviners, to inquire
in what way they should send back the ark. These told them
that, if they wished for deliverance from the plague, the
ark must on no account be sent back empty, but with
a trespass-offering of five golden emerods and five golden
mice, ‘images of your emerods, and images of your mice
that mar the land.’ The ark was to be sent in a new cart,
drawn by two milch kine, while their calves were kept at
home. If the kine took the straight way by the coast to
Beth-shemesh, they would know that it was God that had
smitten them, ‘but if not, then we shall know that it is not
his hand that smote us: it was a chance that happened to
us. And the men did so: and took two milch kine, and
tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
And they laid the ark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer
with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods. And
the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and
went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned not
aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of the
Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh.
And they of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat-harvest
in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
and rejoiced to see it. And the cart came into the field of
Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and stood there, where there was
a great stone: and they clave the wood of the cart, and
offered the kine a burnt-offering unto the Lord. And the
Levites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that
was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on
the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt
offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord
..., which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of
Joshua, the Beth-shemite.’ Fifty thousand and seventy of
the people of Beth-shemesh were smitten with the plague,
‘because they had looked into the ark of the Lord.’</p>

<p>In its essential features the narrative of this plague of
Ashdod is a mere replica of the Homeric plague. The manifest
cause is God’s displeasure, but when it falls on Israelites,
God’s chosen people, as well as on Philistines, it is perplexing,
for knowledge of contagion or communicability is as yet
unborn. But an explanation is ready to hand—the Israelites
<i>also</i> have offended God by looking into the ark. The sin-offerings
are to be representations in gold of the disease,
akin to the votive offerings of diseased parts dedicated in
the sanctuaries of Asclepius, and representations of mice,
which then and after were generally associated with pestilence—imitative
magic again in its simplest form. The sacrificial
stone is left as a commemorative altar for all time. Religion
has now appeared to reinforce magic. The Philistine
diviners do indeed hazard the thought that the plague may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
have been a mere ‘chance that happened to us’, and so
faintly foreshadow a belief in the natural causation of
epidemic disease.</p>

<p>Have we sufficient data to establish the identity of this
contagious pestilence? It broke out on the sea-coast
among a race of maritime traders, and spread from the coast
to other inland towns. It lasted more than seven months. It
took on two forms, a severe type with early death, and a less
fatal type, in which swellings (so-called emerods) developed
in the secret parts, a comprehensive term which habitually
included the whole area adjacent to the genitals, and therein
the groins. On these data alone it is difficult to avoid the
conclusion that it was true oriental plague, with a proportion
of bubonic cases, a disease that throughout its recorded
history has hugged this corner of the Levant.</p>

<p>Votive offerings for the healing of disease generally
portrayed the part diseased, rather than the actual disease,
the latter so often defying plastic representation. But, in
the case of a simple swelling, it is natural that the disease
itself should be modelled.</p>

<p>It is tempting to assert with confidence a direct causal
connexion between the morbid swellings and the mice, for
rats and mice were ill distinguished from each other until
recent times. The matter is further complicated by the
fact that there is considerable doubt as to the authenticity
of parts, at least, of the narrative. The composition of the
Books of Samuel ranged over some seven centuries, from
900-200 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, and the mouse story is believed to be a late
interpolation, of which it is impossible to fix the date.
But in the text, as it stands, the mice are designated ‘mice
that mar the land’, and ancient literature abounds in
records of appalling devastation of crops by the agency of
field-mice. Aelian,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Aristotle,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Strabo,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Theophrastus, Pliny,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
and others testify to this. Loeffler<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> gives an account of
a Thessalian corn-harvest destroyed by a horde of field-voles,
a field being completely devastated in a single night.
Mice were, in fact, one prominent cause of the famine-plagues<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
of history. Viewed in this light, it helps us to
understand another Biblical pestilence, that fell on the army
of Sennacherib, in 701 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, at Pelusium. This campaign
of Sennacherib was undertaken to quell a general revolt of
the western states against Assyrian supremacy and the
payment of tribute to the Assyrian king. The revolt was
fomented, seemingly, by Merodach-Baladan, whom Sargon
had ousted from the kingship of Babylon, and who now
drew Hezekiah into the revolt. He sent an embassy with
gifts to Hezekiah, nominally to congratulate him on his
recovery from a severe illness, which the Bible narrative
terms ‘a boil’. This may perhaps indicate true pustular
plague, but forms of boil (e. g. Baghdad boil), quite distinct
from plague, are familiar occurrences in several regions of
the East. Sennacherib first crushed Merodach-Baladan,
and then advanced against Hezekiah, who at once called
on Tirhaquah, the Ethiopian viceroy of Egypt, for help.
At the pitched battle of Altaku Sennacherib defeated Tirhaquah,
and shut up Hezekiah in Jerusalem, to which he proceeded
to lay siege. Meantime Tirhaquah rallied his army and
again advanced to the aid of Hezekiah, so that Sennacherib
was compelled to march south against him. At Pelusium,
on the border of Egypt, Sennacherib’s army was suddenly
destroyed by a pestilence, that compelled him to withdraw
the remnant at once to Assyria. ‘And it came to pass that
night, that the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the
camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand:
and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
all dead corpses.’<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Isaiah confirms in detail the narrative of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the Book of Kings, and the Chaldaean chronicler, Berosus, in a
fragment preserved by Josephus, states also that Sennacherib
was driven back by pestilence. The prism inscriptions of Sennacherib
are characteristically silent on the subject: they tell only
how he shut up Hezekiah in Jerusalem, like a bird in a cage.</p>

<p>Pelusium has an evil reputation in the annals of pestilence.
Procopius cites it as the starting-point of Justinian’s plague.
There, too, one of the Crusading expeditions developed
plague; and again, in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1799, the army of Napoleon was
infected there and carried the disease into Syria. The
explanation is not far to seek. The eastern and southern
coasts of the Mediterranean, and more particularly Syria,
Egypt, and Libya, were the points to which the merchants of
the East brought their merchandise for exchange with that
of the West. From time immemorial Arab caravans and
camels had traversed well-worn trade-routes from the East
abutting on the Mediterranean at Tyre, Sidon, and Pelusium,
and later at Alexandria. In these meeting-places of East and
West, as also at Constantinople, plague would most readily,
and actually did, find a footing. Possibly the eastern
Delta may have been an endemic centre, but more likely,
as was believed in the late Chinese plague, a distributing
centre was an original source.</p>

<p>Byron in his lines in the <i>Hebrew Melodies</i> on the ‘Destruction
of Sennacherib’ has caught the passionate note of
fervid patriotism, on which the chosen race celebrated their
deliverance from the heathen enemy by the might of their
own God, and has retained the imagery and simple diction
of the Bible story:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> relates that the tradition of this wonderful
deliverance lived on in Egypt also. His cicerone in the temple
of Ptah at Memphis told him the following tale. ‘The next
king was a priest of Vulcan, called Sethos. This monarch
despised and neglected the warrior class of the Egyptians,
as though he did not need their services. Among other
indignities which he offered them, he took from them the
lands which they possessed under all the previous kings,
consisting of twelve acres of choice land for each warrior.
Afterwards, therefore, when Sennacherib, king of the
Arabians and Assyrians, marched his vast army into Egypt,
the warriors one and all refused to come to his aid. On this
the monarch, greatly distressed, entered into the inner
sanctuary, and before the image of the god bewailed the fate
that impended over him. As he wept he fell asleep, and
dreamed that the god came and stood at his side, bidding him
be of good cheer, and go boldly forth to meet the Arabian
host, which would do him no hurt, as he himself would send
those who should help him. Sethos then, relying on the
dream, collected such of the Egyptians as were willing to
follow him, who were none of them warriors, but traders,
artisans, and market people, and with these marched to
Pelusium, which commands the entrance into Egypt, and
there pitched his camp. As the two armies lay here opposite
one another, there came in the night a multitude of field-mice,
which devoured all the quivers and bow-strings of the enemy
and ate the thongs by which they managed their shields.
Next morning they commenced their flight, and great multitudes
fell, as they had no arms with which to defend themselves.
There stands to this day in the temple of Vulcan a stone
statue of Sethos, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription
to this effect: “Look on me and learn to reverence the gods.”’</p>

<p>Strabo<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> has a story of mice eating up the bow-strings,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
and a variant of it appears also in Chinese annals,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> so that
it may be regarded as merely a figurative expression for
some providential deliverance from an enemy, and in the case
of Sennacherib the medium of deliverance was pestilence.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say whose was the statue Herodotus
ascribes to Sethos, for no king Sethos is known in Egyptian
history. Perhaps it was a statue of Horus, the Egyptian
equivalent of Apollo, or not impossibly of Apollo himself,
for we have abundant evidence of the association of the
mouse with Apollo. In the pestilence of the <i>Iliad</i>,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Chryses
addresses him as Mouse-God (Σμινθεύς). Strabo says
that the statue of Apollo Smintheus in Chrysa, a town of
the Troad, had a mouse beneath his foot: so also has
a bronze coin now in the British Museum. De Witte<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> has
figured coins of Alexandria, the more ancient Hamaxitus,
in the Troad, in which Apollo Smintheus is represented with
his bow, and a mouse on his hand. Aelian<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> says that an
effigy of the mouse stood beside the tripod of Apollo. An
ancient bas-relief, of uncertain date, illustrating the Homeric
plague and the offerings of the Greeks to Apollo Smintheus,
also shows a mouse on a tripod. Another shows Apollo
with a mouse beneath his chin: so, too, does a coin of Tenedos.
White mice were actually kept beneath the altar in the
temple of Apollo Smintheus at Hamaxitus, and were fed
at the public expense. Strabo<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> says that the worship of
Apollo Smintheus extended to the whole coast of Asia Minor
and to the neighbouring islands.</p>

<p>Many votive offerings in the form of mice have been found,
at Alexandria Troas,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> in Palestine,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and elsewhere, and
Strabo suggests that the worship of mice originated in a
desire to propitiate mice, so as to induce them not to ravage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the cornfields. The propitiation of animals,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and particularly
of those that infest the crops, is common in the worship of
primitive men. The Philistines are said to have made
images of the mice that marred their land, and sent them out
of their country, so as to induce the real mice to depart
also. In a later stage of worship, when a god has supplanted
the animal, the god is propitiated instead of the pest itself:
hence Mouse Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Locust Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Wolf Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and
Zeus Averter of Flies.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Even lowlier pests are absorbed
into the godhead, so that we have Apollo Erythibius<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
(ἐρυσίβη = mildew), and the Romans personified it and
worshipped it as Robigus<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (<i>robigo</i> = mildew). The Chams
of Indo-China offer sacrifices to a rude pillar-idol, called
Yang-tikuh (god-rat), when swarms of rats infest the
fields.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Thus Apollo seems to stand in the same relation to
the mouse, as Asclepius to the serpent. He not only sends
pestilence, but also wards it off both from man and from
crops. And viewing all the facts we may conclude with some
certainty that the association of mice with famine-pestilence
was well recognized, but of any knowledge at this time of
the association of rats with plague there is little evidence.</p>

<p>Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> asserts that the Persian Magi killed all their
mice and rats, because they and the gods they worshipped
entertained a natural antipathy to them, a feeling which, he
says, they shared with the Arabians and Ethiopians. One
is curious to know what may have been the real ground of
this antipathy, for which Plutarch advances the current
explanation. More than likely it was that experience had
taught these nations the relation of these animals to famine
and perhaps to pestilence as well.</p>

<p>Nicholas Poussin (1593-1665) painted a picture, now in
the Louvre, of the plague of Ashdod. An inferior replica
hangs in the National Gallery, and yet another in the
Academy at Lisbon. Horror is the dominant note of a
composition that is full of movement. High up between
the columns of a temple stands the ark of God. Beside it
the body of Dagon lies prostrate on its pedestal, with head
and hands lying below. A priest points out with his hand the
mutilated image to a group of awe-stricken men, who from
their air of authority seem to be elders of the people. A
swarm of rats has invaded the town. The streets are strewn
with dead and dying of each sex and of every age, and bearers
carry away the corpses. Broken columns, lying here and there
among the plague-stricken, heighten the sense of death and
destruction. In the centre of the foreground is a group that
Poussin has borrowed from Raphael. A woman with bared
breasts lies dead between her two infants: one is dead,
the other is approaching the dead mother’s breast. The
father stoops down with hand stretched out to hold it back:
with his other he muffles his mouth and nose to shut out
infection. To the right another man holds back an older
child who is coming towards the dead woman. One man is
huddled up in a dying convulsion, another lies exhausted
on a broken pillar. On the steps a sick man implores
assistance from one who hurries past him to avoid infection.
To the left a man with pity depicted on his face regards
another writhing in agony. The whole scene is set in the
centre of the town in an open space surrounded by massive
buildings in the classical style that Poussin acquired among
the ruined monuments of Rome. None of the bodies show
any distinctive signs of plague, the disease clearly indicated
by the presence of swarms of rats.</p>

</div>

<p>One other Biblical<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> pestilence, the plague of David,
presents to us another and more enduring image of pestilence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
and represents also a stage at which religion has superseded
magic. David, in punishment for his presumption in numbering
the people, is given the choice of seven years of
famine, three months of fleeing before his enemies, or three
days of pestilence. He chose the last, and seventy thousand
of his people perished. ‘And David lifted up his eyes, and
saw the Angel of the Lord stand between the earth and the
heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over
Jerusalem.’ ‘And when the angel stretched out his hand
upon Jerusalem to destroy it,’ God checked him by the
threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ‘And the Lord
commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into
the sheath thereof.’ Then the prophet Gad told David to
set up an altar in the threshing-floor of Araunah. So David
bought it and set up an altar and offered sacrifice to God,
and the plague was stayed: on the site of this altar Solomon
built the Temple.</p>

<p>Here again pestilence figures as a signal evidence of God’s
displeasure. An angel is the agent by which He spreads the
plague, and the drawn sword, Israel’s favourite weapon,
replaces the bow and arrow. The sheathing of the sword is
the sign that the pestilence is ended. This imagery appears
again and again in Christian literature and art, and seems to
have its origin here. Angels are a beautiful fancy of all
religions of the East. So vivid is the primitive conception of
pestilence, that we find it personified from earliest times:
now as an archer-god: now as one walking in darkness:
now as an angel with drawn sword. David offers the same
expiatory sacrifice and rears a commemorative altar, as was
done in the plague of Ashdod.</p>

<p>Pierre Mignard (1610-95) has painted the plague of
David. The original is lost, but an engraving by Audran
is to be had at the Chalcographie of the Louvre. As with
Poussin, the scene is set with a background of classical
architecture, but the rendering of the figures shows little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
trace of classical feeling. The central theme is the idea of
devotion in the presence of suffering. An angel in the sky
is pouring forth sulphurous fumes from two vessels, as
brimstone and fire were rained down upon Sodom and
Gomorrah. On the peristyle of a temple King David offers
sacrifices of atonement to stay the plague, while the
people prostrate themselves in attitudes of supplication
around the steps of the temple. In the background is a
cascade of water falling into a basin, beside which one man
lies dying, while others endeavour to slake their thirst. Two
men hasten forward to drive them from the basin, before
they pollute its water. This incident is derived with some
licence of interpretation from the narrative of Thucydides.
In the centre of the picture, reminiscent of Raphael, a young
woman lies dying in her husband’s arms, her dead child still
stretched across her knees. In the foreground is a charcoal
brazier giving off purifying fumes. Near it a doctor, who
has just incised a bubo in a woman’s armpit, falls back in
a state of collapse, dropping his bistoury and bowl, while
his assistant, who is still holding the woman’s arm away
from her side, grasps at his master to prevent him falling.
A bystander makes off in horrified dismay. Compassion
and cowardice are here ranged side by side. To the right
two men are distributing food and medicine to the sick.
An attendant kneels to offer a stricken man a cup of water,
while a torch-bearer follows with a lighted torch to disinfect
the air. Close beside them lies a dog dead. To the left one
young woman is giving some remedy in a spoon to another
stretched on the ground, while behind them stand a woman
and child, both in tears. Detached incidents fill in the picture.
A woman grasps a delirious man as he escapes from his
house. A man carries off a girl in his arms. A woman tears
her hair over the dead body of her child. A woman draws
up food to her window with basket and cord.</p>

<p>With the exception of the plague of Ashdod, it is difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
to hazard a guess at the nature of these Biblical plagues.
All through the Old Testament, sword, famine, and pestilence
are habitually linked together. As plague has followed
the flag of commerce, so famine and typhus have followed
the flag of war. During the Thirty Years’ War the whole
of Central Europe was devastated by famine and typhus.
They were rampant in the wake of Napoleon’s armies, and
thousands perished of typhus during the retreat from Moscow.
In the Crimea typhus decimated the ill-fed army of the
French, and only to-day, as it were, have we learnt that the
body-louse stands as the connecting link between famine
and typhus. The eighteenth century in Ireland, even when
war was absent, was an almost unbroken record of famine
and typhus, and Ireland was quit of epidemic typhus only
when she had so widened her area of supplies as to ensure
immunity from famine. For her deliverance from typhus
Ireland is beholden to her potatoes, not to her physicians.
In the light then of the evidence of modern history, typhus
may well have figured prominently in the list of Biblical
plagues. Still there are not wanting many instances in which
true plague has followed hard on the heels of famine; and
in India cholera and dysentery only too often appear, to
complete the work that famine has but half done.</p>

<p>The conception of pestilence as a punishment for sin is
as prominent in Greek as in Hebrew literature. We have
seen it in the Homeric story, and we see it again, where we
should less expect it, in Sophocles. Pestilence still centres
round the personality of Apollo, but whereas in Homer
Apollo stays the plague, in Sophocles he is appealed to only
for knowledge, whereby to stay it. Homer endows him with
special power, Sophocles only with special knowledge. In
Homer he is the god of the bright light (φοῖβος), that
dispels the darkness of pestilence: in Sophocles his is the
light that illumines the dark places of mind.</p>

<p>The <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> seems to have been first publicly
performed between 429-420 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, possibly therefore before
the plague of Athens had finally died out. Sophocles is
certainly not describing the plague of Athens in the guise
of a Theban plague, but it must needs have coloured his
thoughts as well as those of his audience. His description
of the pestilence blighting the crops, and causing murrain
among cattle and disease and death among men, suggests
one of the famine plagues common in ancient history.
Hesiod<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was not unaware of them (λιμὸν ὁμοῦ καὶ λοιμόν).
Sophocles is the first writer to attempt even in outline
a description of pestilence, and in doing so he has drawn
the picture of pestilence sent by the gods for the punishment
of sin. The way of atonement is sought for at Delphi,
and pending this knowledge supplication is made to
Athena, Artemis, and Apollo, the deities who control pestilence
and have the plague-stricken city in their special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
keeping. Here is the invocation to Apollo, the Delian
Healer:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Set in this archaic atmosphere the <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i> reads
strange beside the realistic record of Thucydides, published
only a few years later. But Sophocles has given only in
outline what Thucydides has given in arresting detail.</p>

<p class="tb">To the historian, the physician, and the man of letters, the
account given by Thucydides of the plague of Athens, in the
course of the Peloponnesian War, must stand for all time
as one of the most remarkable documents in the whole annals
of pestilence. In view of the much greater strength of the
Lacedaemonian land-force, it was the unwavering policy of
Pericles to keep the Athenians within their walls, allowing the
Lacedaemonians to exhaust themselves in devastating Attic
territory, while retaliating on the coasts of Peloponnesus
by the Athenian fleet. Each year, at the approach of the
Lacedaemonian army, the inhabitants of Attica flocked
within the walls of Athens, bringing with them all their
movable property, after sending their sheep and cattle to
Euboea and the neighbouring islands, so that the added
horror of a great epizootic was averted. The greater number
encamped in the vacant spaces of the city and Piraeus, and
in and around the numerous temples. Some housed their
families in the towers and recesses of the city walls, or in
sheds, cabins, tents, or even tubs, disposed throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
course of the long walls. This was the overcrowded state
of beleaguered Athens, when pestilence broke out in the
second year of the Peloponnesian War (430 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>), putting
the policy of Pericles to a crucial test.</p>

<p>After ravaging the plain, the Peloponnesians devastated
the coastlands of Attica, first on the south coast, and then
on the north. Pericles forthwith equipped an Athenian
naval squadron, and launched his counterstroke against the
Peloponnese. This fleet carried 4,000 hoplites and 300
cavalry, who ravaged the district round Epidaurus, and other
towns on the adjacent coast. It seems, however, despite
the rumour to the contrary, which Thucydides faithfully
records, that neither the pestilence nor the operations of
this expeditionary force actually accelerated the departure
of the Lacedaemonians, for they stayed 40 days, which was
longer than any other stay. Pestilence broke out in this
expeditionary force, and is doubtless the reason that it
returned without accomplishing more. Plutarch indeed
says that the Athenians would have captured Epidaurus,
but for this outbreak of sickness.</p>

<p>The Athenians also sent another fleet this same summer
against Potidaea in Thrace, which was already undergoing
a siege at the hands of an Athenian army. Pestilence
worked fearful havoc in this supplementary force and
spread from it to the troops who were already there, involving
a mortality of 1,050 out of a total of 4,000 hoplites, so that
the expedition was compelled to return and leave the siege
to the troops that were there before them.</p>

<p>In their despair the Athenians vented their angry feelings
on Pericles, just as persons in a delirium, says Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
turn on their physician or their father. They urged that
the pestilence was due to cooping up in the city in stifling
huts a rural population accustomed to an open-air existence,
so that they conveyed infection to one another. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
popular resentment subsided as quickly as it arose. In
a noble speech, which Thucydides reproduces at length,
Pericles weaned them to a better mind. His own domestic
sufferings may have stirred their sympathy. He lost of the
pestilence his only two legitimate sons, Xanthippus and
Paralus, his sister, and many relatives and friends. The
death of his favourite son, Paralus, left him with no legitimate
heir to maintain the family and the hereditary sacred
rites. ‘That blow’, says Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> ‘crushed him to earth.
He struggled indeed to preserve his wonted impassiveness
and to maintain his serene composure. But, as he laid
a wreath upon the body and looked upon his dead, the
anguish of it all overwhelmed him, and he burst out wailing
and sobbing bitterly—a thing which in all his life he had
never before done.’ The spectacle of this proud, reserved
man, this man who had stood firm as a rock amid the rising
tide of popular resentment, humbled before God, humiliated
before man, as the iron seared his innermost soul, is one of the
most moving pictures in all history and literature.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">My solitude and grief have brought me low.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>‘Shortly after this, it appears, the pestilence laid hold
on Pericles. The attack was not, as in other cases, sharp
and severe. It took the form of an ailment, slight but
protracted through a variety of phases, which slowly
wasted his strength and undermined the vigour of his
mind.’ But if we may judge by the accounts of his death-bed
given by Plutarch himself, and by Theophrastus in his
<i>Ethics</i>, his mind was free from any taint of insanity.</p>

<p>The first outbreak of pestilence lasted for two years,
from the spring of 430 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> to that of 428 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, then came
a partial, but not complete, abatement for one and a half
years, followed by another outbreak in 427 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> which
lasted a year. ‘To the power of Athens’, says Thucydides,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
‘certainly nothing was more ruinous. Not less than 4,400
Athenian hoplites, who were on the roll, died, and also
300 horsemen, and an incalculable number of the common
people’, estimated by Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> at 10,000 freemen
and slaves. Bury<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> puts the total number of Athenian
burghers (of both sexes and all ages) at the commencement
of the Peloponnesian War at 100,000, and this total was
reduced by the pestilence to some 80,000 or less. The
metic class and the slaves he estimates roundly at 30,000
and 100,000 respectively, but beyond the unreliable statement
of Diodorus Siculus, we have no index of their reduction.
In accepting the verdict of Thucydides on the disastrous
effects of the pestilence on the power of Athens, we must
not forget that there were other influences at work, conspiring
to this same result, the consequences of which Pericles had
pointed out clearly in his speech before the war. Had it
not been for these, Athens would beyond doubt have rallied
quickly from the blow, as we shall see that other cities
have habitually done in like case with hers.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which the epidemic broke out
a second time in Athens cannot have differed greatly from
those prevailing at its first onset, for though it was winter
and the Lacedaemonian army was not in the field, the
surrounding country had been devastated, and most of the
peasantry must still have been cooped up, in a state of
overcrowding, within the walls. As the pestilence lingered
on in Athens, superstition laid fast hold on the populace,
under the stress of their protracted sufferings. On the
advice of the oracle, they decided to purify the island of
Delos, which formerly had been dedicated to Apollo, but
latterly had been used as a burial-ground. All the dead
were transferred to a neighbouring island Rhene, and a
law was passed forbidding henceforth the burial of
a corpse or the birth of a child in Delos. The neglected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
panegyric festival of Apollo was also revived in the island.
No stone was left unturned to appease the god, who, the
Athenians now were persuaded, had sent them the distemper.</p>

<p>Earthquakes and inundations lasted, as did the pestilence,
throughout the summer of 426 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Diodorus Siculus seems
to suggest that the earthquakes were sent by Apollo, who
had been duly propitiated, to divert the Lacedaemonians
from the invasion of Attica. Actually they did effect this,
for Agis, King of Sparta, though already arrived at the
isthmus, accepted the omen and led his army back. Neither
Thucydides nor Diodorus Siculus asserts any direct causal
relation between the earthquakes and the pestilence—a
belief, which if now vaguely foreshadowed, took definite
form only at a later date.</p>

<p>The following is the full narrative<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of the pestilence, as
given by Thucydides:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘As soon as summer returned, the Peloponnesian army,
comprising as before two-thirds of the force of each confederate
state, under the command of the Lacedaemonian
king Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus, invaded Attica,
where they established themselves and ravaged the country.
They had not been there many days when the plague broke
out at Athens for the first time. <i>It</i> is said to have previously
smitten many places, particularly Lemnos, but there is
no record of <i>so great</i> a pestilence occurring elsewhere, or of
<i>such</i> a destruction of human life. For a while physicians,
in ignorance of the nature of the disease, sought to apply
remedies; but it was in vain, and they themselves were
among the first victims, because they oftenest came into
contact with it. No human art was of any avail, and as
to supplications in temples, enquiries of oracles, and the
like, they were utterly useless, and at last men were overpowered
by the calamity and gave them all up. The
disease is said to have begun south of Egypt in Ethiopia:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
thence it descended into Egypt and Libya, and after
spreading over the greater part of the Persian empire,
suddenly fell upon Athens. It first attacked the inhabitants
of the Piraeus, and it was supposed that the Peloponnesians
had poisoned the cisterns, no conduits having as yet been
made there. It afterwards reached the upper city, and then
the mortality became far greater. As to its probable origin
or the causes which might or could have produced such
a disturbance of nature, every man, whether a physician or
not, will give his own opinion. But I shall describe its actual
<i>character</i>, and the symptoms by which any one who knows
them beforehand may recognize the disorder, should it ever
reappear. For I was myself attacked, and witnessed the
sufferings of others.</p>

<p>The season was admitted to have been remarkably free
from ordinary sickness; and if anybody was already ill
of any other disease, it was absorbed in this. Many who
were in perfect health, all in a moment, and without any
apparent reason, were seized with violent heats in the
head and with redness and inflammation of the eyes. Internally
the throat and the tongue were quickly suffused with
blood, and the breath became unnatural and fetid. There
followed sneezing and hoarseness; in a short time the
disorder, accompanied by a violent cough, reached the chest;
then fastening lower down, it would move the stomach and
bring on all the vomits of bile to which physicians have ever
given names; and they were very distressing. An ineffectual
retching producing violent <i>straining</i> attacked most of the
sufferers; some as soon as the previous symptoms had
abated, others not until long afterwards. The body externally
was not so very hot to the touch, nor yet pale: it
was of a livid colour inclining to red, and breaking out in
pustules and ulcers. But the internal fever was intense:
the sufferers could not bear to have on them even the
finest linen garment. They insisted on being naked, and
there was nothing which they longed for more eagerly than
to throw themselves into cold water. And many of those
who had no one to look after them actually plunged into
the cisterns, for they were tormented by unceasing thirst,
which was not in the least assuaged whether they drank
little or much. They could not sleep: a restlessness which
was intolerable never left them. While the disease was at
its height the body, instead of wasting away, held out amid
these sufferings in a marvellous manner, and either they died
on the seventh or ninth day, not of weakness, for their strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
was not exhausted, but of internal fever, which was the end
of most; or, if they survived, then the disease descended
into the bowels and there produced violent ulceration;
severe diarrhoea at the same time set in, and at a later stage
caused exhaustion, which finally with few exceptions carried
them off. For the disorder which had originally settled in
the head passed gradually through the whole body, and, if
a person got over the worst, would often seize the extremities
and leave its mark, attacking the privy parts and the fingers
and the toes; and some escaped with the loss of these, some
with the loss of their eyes. Some again had no sooner
recovered than they were seized with a forgetfulness of
all things and knew neither themselves nor their friends.</p>

<p>The malady took a form <i>beyond description</i>, and the fury
with which it fastened upon each sufferer was too much for
human nature to endure. There was one circumstance in
particular which distinguished it from ordinary diseases.
The birds and animals which feed on human flesh, although
so many bodies were lying unburied, either never came near
them, or died if they touched them. This was proved by
a remarkable disappearance of the birds of prey, who were
not to be seen either about the bodies or anywhere else:
while in the case of the dogs the fact was even more obvious,
because they live with man.</p>

<p>Such was the general nature of the disease: I omit
many strange peculiarities which characterized individual
cases. None of the ordinary sicknesses attacked any one
while it lasted, or if they did, they ended in the plague.
Some of the sufferers died from want of care, others equally
who were receiving the greatest attention. No single remedy
could be deemed a specific: for that which did good to one
did harm to another. No constitution was of itself strong
enough to resist or weak enough to escape the attacks:
the disease carried off all alike and defied every mode of
treatment. Most appalling was the despondency which
seized upon any one who felt himself sickening: for he
instantly abandoned his mind to despair and, instead of
holding out, absolutely threw away his chance of life.
Appalling too was the rapidity with which men caught
the infection: dying like sheep if they attended on one
another: and this was the principal cause of mortality.
When they were afraid to visit one another, the sufferers
died in their solitude, so that many houses were empty
because there had been no one left to take care of the sick;
or if they ventured they perished, especially those who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
aspired to heroism. For they went to see their friends without
thought of themselves and were ashamed to leave them,
even at a time when the very relations of the dying were
at last growing weary and ceased to make lamentations,
overwhelmed by the vastness of the calamity. But whatever
instances there may have been of such devotion, more
often the sick and the dying were tended by the pitying care
of those who had recovered, because they knew the course
of the disease and were themselves free from apprehension.
For no one was ever attacked a second time, or with
a fatal result. All men congratulated them, and they
themselves, in the excess of their joy at the moment, had
an innocent fancy that they could not die of any other
sickness.</p>

<p>The crowding of the people out of the country into the
city aggravated the misery; and the newly-arrived suffered
most. For, having no houses of their own, but inhabiting
in the height of summer stifling huts, the mortality among
them was dreadful, and they perished in wild disorder. The
dead lay as they had died, one upon another, while others
hardly alive wallowed in the streets and crawled about every
fountain craving for water. The temples in which they
lodged were full of the corpses of those who died in them:
for the violence of the calamity was such that men, not
knowing where to turn, grew reckless of all law, human and
divine. The customs which had hitherto been observed
at funerals were universally violated, and they buried their
dead each one as best he could. Many, having no proper
appliances, because the deaths in their household had been
so frequent, made no scruple of using the burial-place of
others. When one man had raised a funeral pile, others
would come, and throwing on their dead first, set fire to
it; or when some other corpse was already burning, before
they could be stopped would throw their own dead upon it
and depart.</p>

<p>There were other and worse forms of lawlessness which
the plague introduced at Athens. Men who had hitherto
concealed their indulgence in pleasure now grew bolder.
For seeing the sudden change—how the rich died in a moment,
and those who had nothing immediately inherited their
property—they reflected that life and riches were alike
transitory, and they resolved to enjoy themselves while
they could, and to think only of pleasure. Who would be
willing to sacrifice himself to the law of honour when he
knew not whether he would ever live to be held in honour?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
The pleasure of the moment and any sort of thing which
conduced to it took the place both of honour and of expediency.
No fear of God or law of man deterred a criminal.
Those, who saw all perishing alike, thought that the worship
or neglect of the Gods made no difference. For offences
against human law no punishment was to be feared: no
one would live long enough to be called to account. Already
a far heavier sentence had been passed and was hanging
over a man’s head: before that fell, why should he not take
a little pleasure?</p>

<p>Such was the grievous calamity which now afflicted the
Athenians: within the walls their people were dying, and
without, their country was being ravaged. In their troubles
they naturally called to mind a verse which the elder men
among them declared to have been current long ago:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A Dorian war will come and a plague with it.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There was a dispute about the precise expression: some
saying that <i>limos</i>, a famine, and not <i>loimos</i>, a plague, was
the original word. Nevertheless, as might have been
expected, for men’s memories reflected their sufferings, the
argument in favour of <i>loimos</i> prevailed at the time. But if
ever in future years another Dorian war arises which
happens to be accompanied by a famine, they will probably
repeat the verse in the other form. The answer of the oracle
to the Lacedaemonians when the God was asked “whether
they should go to war or not”, and he replied “that if they
fought with all their might, they would conquer, and that
he himself would take their part”, was not forgotten by
those who had heard of it, and they quite imagined that they
were witnessing the fulfilment of his words. The disease
certainly did set in immediately after the invasion of the
Peloponnesians, and did not spread to the Peloponnesus
in any degree worth speaking of, while Athens felt its
ravages most severely, and next to Athens the places
which were most populous. Such was the history of the
plague.’</p>

</div>

<p>A careful study, line upon line and word by word, of the
description which Thucydides has given of the clinical
features of the Athenian pestilence, viewing it on the one
hand in the light of the medical knowledge of the time,
and on the other in the light of the revelations of modern
pathology, can hardly fail to bring home to an unbiased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
judgement the conviction that we have to do with typhus
fever. It is true that it bears a close resemblance to Oriental
plague, but whereas the objections to this diagnosis seem
to us to be insuperable, we shall hope to show that those
which hitherto have appeared obstacles to the diagnosis of
typhus fever, are either artificial or based upon an incorrect
interpretation of the text. The confusion of typhus fever
and Oriental plague prevailed down to comparatively modern
times even among medical writers; not only is there a striking
resemblance in the clinical picture of the two diseases, but
they have been constantly commingled in one and the same
epidemic. This is no matter for surprise, when we remember
that the flea is the chief agent in the propagation of one
disease, and the body-louse of the other.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a single writer of the sixteenth, seventeenth,
or eighteenth centuries on the subject of fevers,
who has not commented on the concurrence of malignant
fevers with epidemics of Oriental plague. It is true that they
do not all identify the malignant fevers as typhus, simply
because typhus, though distinguished as a morbid entity
by Fracastorius as early as 1546, did not become generally
recognized throughout Europe until the eighteenth century,
and even then its identity was obscured under a multiplicity
of synonyms. Ambroise Paré, in 1568, described a pestilential
fever as prevailing in France along with true plague, in
which the skin was marked with spots, like the bites of fleas
or bugs. Vilalba says that on several occasions during the
sixteenth century a spotted fever called Tabardiglio, which
is now known to have been typhus, was rife in Spain at
the same time as plague, and was much confused with it.
According to Lotz a malignant spotted fever was present
in London in 1624, which turned to plague in 1625, and back
again to spotted fever in 1626. Similarly Sydenham states
that the Great Plague of London was preceded and followed
by a pestilent fever, which from his description was clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
typhus, and he remarks that it differed from the plague
only in the milder character of its symptoms. According to
Diemerbroeck spotted fever (typhus) preceded plague in
Holland in 1636, and its malignity increased progressively,
until finally it became converted into true plague. The
same is true of the plague of Marseilles in 1720, of the plague
of Aleppo in 1760, and of the plague of Moscow in 1771.
Hancock, in 1821, asserted that nearly all the most remarkable
plagues of the last two centuries had been preceded by
typhus. So much for the confusion of these two diseases,
due to their concurrence.</p>

<p>Murchison, whose treatise on typhus stands out as a
monument of acute and accurate observation, traces out
in detail the resemblance of the two diseases. It is no
matter only of a general clinical resemblance, such as is
common to most acute infectious fevers, though that is
striking enough, but beyond this there is a remarkable
similarity in particular symptoms, in clinical course, and in
complications. There is a tendency to regard buboes as
a distinctive feature of plague, but these are found in a small
moiety of cases of typhus fever. On the other side of the
picture, the petechial eruptions of typhus, its most distinctive
feature, are common enough in plague.</p>

<p>It is tempting to shirk the difficulty of a differential diagnosis
by assuming that in Athens, as so often elsewhere,
there was a simultaneous outbreak of typhus and plague,
but the whole evidence points strongly to the presence of
typhus, and typhus only. We will endeavour to present the
evidence fairly and simply, so that every reader may
form his own conclusion, by reference to the appended
narrative of Thucydides.</p>

<p>Starting in Ethiopia rumour had it that the disease spread
northwards to Egypt and Libya, and thence over the greater
part of the Persian Empire, which at that time included
almost all of Western Asia, then suddenly it swooped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
down upon Athens. The same disease was said to have
previously attacked Lemnos and many other places, but
with much less severity. With Lemnos Thucydides will
have had close acquaintance, for it lay in the direct route
to Thrace, where he owned property. He is careful to say
that he gives this information as well as that of its starting-point
and lines of extension only on hearsay evidence. If
it were really part of one vast pandemic, it is surprising
that he should have no more certain knowledge of its
incidence. True, pestilence was raging this self-same year
in Rome, but it must not be assumed that it was necessarily
of the same character as that at Athens. All through the
fifth century Rome was seldom without pestilence, and
Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus record a succession
of epidemics, some of several years’ duration, following
hard one upon another. If the origin in Ethiopia and the
subsequent lines of advance are to be accepted, this would
certainly constitute a weighty argument in favour of
Oriental plague. Of late years an endemic focus of plague
has been located in Central Africa, and in its spread the
disease was following established routes of commerce, as
has habitually been the case. Pandemicity too is an inherent
tendency of plague. Typhus has followed for the most part
the march of armies, and in the wake of famine, and has
shown but little tendency to adhere to the beaten routes of
commerce. Typhus has in some instances extended at one
and the same time over a wide region, but for the most part
it has been over contiguous tracts of land. Thus Hildebrand
recorded an epidemic spreading to the whole of Germany,
Galicia, Hungary and the Austrian crown-lands.</p>

<p>Thucydides has laid it down that the plague of Athens
was an unknown disease. Now there is a good deal of evidence
to suggest that bubonic plague was recognized, in its
sporadic form, as a clinical entity at the time of Thucydides.
The language of a passage in the 2nd Book of the Epidemics,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
a treatise of the Hippocratic school, seems hardly susceptible
of any other interpretation: οἱ ἐπὶ βουβῶσι πυρετοὶ κακόν,
πλὴν τῶν ἐφημέρων, καὶ οἱ ἐπὶ πυρετοῖσι βουβῶνες κακίονες
(‘fever supervening on buboes is a bad sign, except
they be ephemeral: but buboes supervening on fever still
worse’). The allusions also to buboes in Aristophanes are
so numerous as almost to preclude any other conclusion:
and it cannot be argued that these were an aftermath of
the epidemic, for Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> implicitly asserts the complete
disappearance of the disease.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the pestilence first in the Piraeus suggests
importation by sea. Sea-carriage is far more characteristic
of plague than of typhus, though typhus has been imported
often enough from Ireland into England, and was also brought
back to England by the troops from Corunna, and to France
by the French troops from the Crimea. On the other hand,
it was in Piraeus chiefly that the displaced peasantry were
crowded together promiscuously in small stifling habitations,
affording just those conditions in which typhus has habitually
arisen and become epidemic.</p>

<p>Among those epidemic diseases, that in past times have
devastated beleaguered cities, typhus unquestionably holds
pride of place. Granada in 1489, Metz in 1552, Montpellier
in 1623, Reading in 1643, Genoa in 1799, Saragossa in 1808,
Dantzig and Wilna in 1813, and Torgau in 1814 all tell the
same tale. With our lately acquired knowledge of the
transmission of typhus fever by the agency of body-lice, it
is easy to understand the prevalence of the disease in epidemic
virulence among a beleaguered and overcrowded garrison.
Murchison, whose knowledge and experience of typhus
were unequalled, unhesitatingly identified the plague of
Athens as typhus, both because of this special circumstance
of its occurrence and because of the clinical picture as a
whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>The passing remarks of Thucydides on the causation of
the pestilence show him not only superior to the superstitious
credulity of some of his fellow countrymen, but far in advance
of the most enlightened medical opinion of his day.
There were still some in Athens, who put their faith in
supplications in temples and inquiries of oracles: but these
measures were now weighed in the balance and found wanting.
The stern probation of the Persian wars had taught the
lesson, that victory was the reward of the strong, not the
recompense of the devout; and with this knowledge
perished the whole fabric of Greek polytheism. So now
most of the populace ascribed the pestilence to natural
causation: the Lacedaemonians surely had poisoned the
wells. From this day onwards, right down to modern
times, this phantom of poison dogs the footsteps of
pestilence.</p>

<p>Thucydides leaves no doubt whatever as to his own
views: he has done for good and all with supernatural
causation, though he confesses his inability to identify the
precise cause, leaving that for others to speculate about.
He states and accepts without reserve contagion from man
to man. In this his great contemporary, Hippocrates, lags
far behind him. The mind of the Father of Medicine was
still in bondage to the early Greek physicists. Conceiving
disease to be caused in man by bodily disturbance, referable
either to the character of the air inspired or of the food and
drink ingested, it was inevitable that, in the causation of
epidemic disease, Hippocrates should assign chief importance
to changes in the atmosphere, to which all alike would be
equally exposed. He does indeed recognize the possibility
of its contamination with alien putrid effluvia, but for all
that it is the mere physical changes in its constitution, which
in his view are of paramount importance. Of contagion
from man to man he had not the vaguest conception, and to
him, as well as to Galen, and even to our own Sydenham, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
sole criterion of epidemicity was the incidence of disease
on a large number of persons at the same time.</p>

<p>To the student of the history of medicine it will be no
matter for surprise that Thucydides should have seen with
undimmed vision, what Hippocrates saw as yet only through
a glass darkly. Medicine in every age has been the bond-servant
of plausible preconceptions, and it is humiliating
to professional self-complacency to scan the long array of
lay writers from Thucydides onwards, who accepted contagion
as a proven fact, before the scales fell from the eyes
of obscurantist Science. Out of many we may enumerate
Aristotle, Lucretius, Diodorus Siculus, Vergil, Ovid, Dionysius
of Halicarnassus, Livy, Seneca, Silius Italicus, the elder
Pliny, and Plutarch: while not till Aretaeus of Cappadocia,
in the second century after Christ, do we meet clear and
unequivocal acceptance in any medical author. Science,
untempered by letters, is apt to induce a mental myopia,
and we men of medicine would do well to reflect on the story
of Archimedes, who, while drawing mathematical figures
in the sand, overlooked to the cost of his life the fact, that
the city had fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Though Thucydides was the first of extant writers to
enunciate clearly the doctrine of contagion, there is reason
to think that Oriental medicine had already grasped the
idea. The Levitical ordinances seem to recognize it in the
case of leprosy. It is true that these had not reached their
final recension till after the time of Thucydides, but at the
same time they represent a body of much older tradition.</p>

<p>Thucydides is careful to state that the season was not
a sickly one, for Hippocrates himself attributed pestilence
to heat and south winds distempering the atmosphere, and
following the example of Acron and Empedocles of Agrigentum,
essayed to alter the constitution of the atmosphere,
in a season of pestilence, by kindling large fires. Acron
aimed only at reducing its humidity, but Hippocrates may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
have sought to destroy by fumigation putrid effluvia,
engendered by the heat in the air. His example was
scrupulously followed in the Plague of London in 1666,
and in that of Marseilles in 1720. A comparison of Thucydides
with Diodorus Siculus redounds but little to the
credit of the latter. Diodorus submits three distinct agencies
as producing the plague of Athens by their concerted action.
First, that so much rain had fallen in the preceding winter,
that the soil had become saturated and waterlogged:
following upon this an unusually hot summer led to the
exhalation from the soil of putrid effluvia, that contaminated
the air. In fact pestilence was a product of the marsh
miasma. Empedocles of Agrigentum was reputed to have
delivered Selinus from a pestilence, in the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>,
by draining its marshes, and an extant coin commemorates
the event: and Hippocrates clearly recognized the association
of periodic (i. e. malarial) fevers with marshes.</p>

<p>Secondly, he cites lack of good food as a contributory
cause, for the rain had also damaged the grain. This was
not an unreasonable proposition, for the prevalence of the
ergot fungus in rye grain after a wet season has given rise
to many and widespread epidemics of ergotism.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the Etesian winds did not blow, so that the air
became superheated, inflaming men’s bodies with all sorts
of burning distempers. It is enough for Diodorus that
Hippocrates, Lucretius, and others had postulated these
causes of pestilence, to secure for them acceptance in the
sober record of his history. Thucydides declines even to
discuss such vague hypotheses, and chooses for himself the
better part of describing the actual symptoms of the disease,
as he had experienced them in his own person, and witnessed
them in the sufferings of others, so that any one familiar
with them might be able to recognize the disorder at once,
in the event of its reappearance.</p>

<p>To Thucydides then is due the credit not only of the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
detailed description of an actual visitation of pestilence,
but of a description that breathes in every line the true spirit
of history, the recording of past events as a medium for the
surer forecasting of the future—the spirit that animates
him in all his historical writing to give ‘a true picture of
the events which have happened, and of the like events
which may be expected to happen hereafter in the order of
human things’—the whole duty of the historian, which
not even Herodotus had recognized to the full before him.
So anxious is he that his readers shall see things as he saw
them, and learn the same lessons from them as he has learnt,
that he is willing on occasion to manipulate his narrative,
as when he brings forward the great Funeral Speech of
Pericles into immediate juxtaposition to the narrative of
the pestilence, assuredly so as to heighten the dramatic
effect. So vivid and so forcible is his picture of the plague,
that it is difficult to believe that some ten years had elapsed
before he set pen to paper, and some thirty or more before the
whole attained its present form. It is no matter for surprise
that Lucretius, Procopius, Boccaccio, and Froissart should
have paid the homage of conscious imitation to this virile
narrative. (See Appendix.)<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Thucydides was the first to draw a picture of the demoralization
of society in the presence of pestilence—a
theme that became a commonplace with later historians
of plague. The futility of the physicians, the merciless
march of the pestilence, the sufferings of the sick, the
neglect of the dead, the pollution of temples, the sacrilegious
funeral rites, these scenes and the like throng the kaleidoscope
of human misery. The sacred ties of kinship yielded
under the cruel emotion of fear. Lawlessness prevailed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
everywhere, for men seeing the uncertainty of life and riches
resolved to enjoy themselves, while they could. Those who
saw all perishing alike thought that worship or neglect of the
gods made no difference.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine what traces of the pestilence are
to be found in contemporary Greek art and architecture.
By some the statue of Health Athena, set up by the Athenians
just outside the eastern portico of the Propylaea, is believed
to have commemorated the passing of the plague of Athens.
Her cult was much older than this, and perhaps derives
from some primitive conception of an Earth Mother, the
great protectress of all her children, as in Christian hagiology
the Madonna of Health shelters them from plague and
pestilence.</p>

<p>Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> regards the romantic temple of Apollo at
Bassae as a memorial of the deliverance of Phigalia from
an offset of this plague of 430 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> He seems to infer this
from the dedication of the temple to Apollo, under his surname
the Helper (Ἐπικούριος). On the other hand, we
know from Thucydides<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> that the plague scarcely touched
Peloponnesus. It is unlikely also that an Athenian architect,
Ictinus, who as Pausanias says built it, would have worked
for the Peloponnesians during the war with Athens.</p>

<p>The same doubt attaches to the attribution of the temple
of Apollo the Helper at Elis, and that of Pan the Deliverer
in Troezen, and the tradition appears in each case to be
referable to the surname of the god, coupled with the dates
at which they were erected.</p>

<p>Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> says that a statue of Apollo, Averter of Evil
(Ἀλεξίκακος), by Calamis, was erected in Athens as a
memorial of deliverance from the plague, but this cannot
be the case, as Calamis was dead before the plague commenced.</p>

<p>Such dedications were, however, common enough. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
Epimenides freed Athens from pestilence he cleansed the
city and set up a shrine to the Eumenides, and the people
of Tanagra<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> similarly showed their gratitude to Hermes the
Ram-bearer (Κριοφόρος) by entrusting to Calamis the
erection of a statue in his honour.</p>

<p>Poussin painted a ‘Plague of Athens’, a much perished
picture now in the gallery of Sir Frederick Cook at Richmond.
It is a dull wooden composition, and compares most unfavourably
with his ‘Plague of Ashdod’, in spite of the close
similarity of incident and episode that it depicts.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</h2>

</div>

<p>Unlike Greece, young Rome was subject to repeated
pestilence: plagues punctuate the pages of her history.
We shall see how deep an imprint they left on the nascent
religion, literature, and art of Rome.</p>

<p>At first these plagues must needs have been endemic,
and bred no doubt in the extensive swamps that lay within
the city and around it for many miles, for Rome was not then
a commercial city. Her corn she derived from Italy and
Sicily, and held little or no intercourse with Egypt, until
after the conquest of Carthage. Yet, in spite of the numerous
records of her pestilences that have survived, there is not
one the nature of which can be identified before the true
Plague of Gregory the Great.</p>

<p>According to Plutarch<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> there was pestilence in Italy and
Rome in the eighth year of Numa Pompilius (707 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>),
forty-six years after the foundation of the city: the legend
of it is full of interest. During its course a brazen buckler
fell from heaven into the hands of Numa. Egeria and the
Muses told him its meaning. It had been sent from heaven
for the preservation of the city, and to prevent its theft
eleven more were to be made so exactly like it, that no
thief should be able to distinguish it from the rest. The
immediate cessation of the pestilence seemed to verify this
interpretation. One Veturius Mamurius successfully produced
the eleven copies, and Numa gave charge of all the
bucklers to the Salii, so called from the dance they led up
the streets, when, in the month of March, they carried the
sacred bucklers through the city. ‘On that occasion’,
says Plutarch, ‘they are habited in purple vests, girt with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
broad belts of brass: they wear also brazen helmets, and
carry short swords, with which they strike upon the bucklers,
and to those sounds they keep time with their feet. They
move in an agreeable manner, performing certain involutions
and evolutions in a quick measure, with vigour, agility, and
ease.... The reward that Mamurius had for his art was, we
are told, an ode, which the Salii sung in memory of him,
along with the Pyrrhic dance. Some, however, say that it
was not Veturius Mamurius, who was celebrated in that
composition, but <i>vetus memoria</i>, the ancient remembrance
of the thing.’ The legend affords unmistakable evidence
of some expiatory ceremony, first introduced for relief of
a definite plague, but subsequently, in view of the constant
recurrence, performed twice a year. Plutarch omits one
significant feature of the Salic ritual, the driving of a skin-clad
man, called Mamurius Veturius (the old Mars), through
the streets, while the Salii showered blows on him, and drove
him out of the city. The examples in ancient folk-lore<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of
animal and human scapegoats, for the exorcising of pestilence
are so numerous, that we may well seek the interpretation
of this Salic ceremony in the persistence of this conception.
The dancing, singing, and clashing of shields was perhaps
intended to drive out the evil demon from the city as
a preliminary to transferring it to the scapegoat Mamurius.
At Tanagra, the youth who annually carried a ram on
his shoulders round the walls of the city, did so as a representative
of the Ram-bearing Hermes, who averted a plague
in this same fashion.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Plutarch discusses the meaning of these bucklers, called
Ancilia, so it was said, from their curved form (ἀγκύλον).
He suggests as alternative derivations, ἀνέκαθεν = from on
high: or ἄκεσις = healing of sick: or αὐχμῶν λύσις =
putting an end to drought: or ἀνάσχεσις = deliverance from
calamities. But whatever the etymological significance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
their ritual purpose would seem to have been to ward off
the darts and arrows of pestilence, and the Salic ceremonial
was dedicated to the honour of the sender. God he was not,
for the religion of Numa’s Rome knew no gods of human
form: these were a later importation from the anthropomorphic
religion of Greece. He was some <i>numen</i>, some
power less personal than a god, but more personal than a
spirit. It was he that engendered pestilence by his evil
machinations. The legend brings us back again close to
the confines of imitative magic. True, it is not the agent
of pestilence that is fashioned, not the brazen serpent, not
the mice, not the emerods, but the agent of deliverance,
‘thy shield and buckler.’</p>

<p>In later years the Salii figure as colleges of priests, dedicated
first to the worship of Mars, and later of Quirinus as
well. The transformation served to obscure their true
origin, which Plutarch asserts and which there is every
reason to accept. Mars was not originally a god of war, but
an agricultural god, and, like Apollo, a guardian of the crops.
Coincidently with the transformation the ritual assumed
a more martial character, the Salii performing the war-dance
in full fighting panoply, as the procession moved through the
city twice a year, in March and October. The beginning and
end of the season of pestilence had faded insensibly into
the beginning and end of the campaigning season. Horace<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
recounts the aldermanic magnificence of their festive repast.</p>

<p>The hymn of the Salii was written in archaic Saturnian
verse, fragments of which have come down to us. Quintilian<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
says that, by the first century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> the primitive language,
passed down with verbal exactitude from generation to generation,
had become unintelligible to those who ceremoniously
recited it. One fragment is instructive in its significance:</p>

<p>(‘When thou thunderest, thou god of Light, they tremble
at thy presence, when the lightning shafts have thundered
from thy right hand.’) These lines recall the figure of Apollo
the Far-Darter in the <i>Iliad</i>, and his invocation in the
<i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>.</p>

<p>Pestilence was in Rome again just before the death of
Tullus Hostilius<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> in 640 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Tullus himself fell ill, and in
his illness revived every superstitious usage, though when in
health he had affected to scorn religion. The people also
cherished the conviction that only by obtaining pardon of
the gods would they be rid of the pestilence. So Tullus
consulted the commentaries of Numa, and finding that
certain sacrifices should have been paid to Jupiter Elicius
(<i>elicere</i> = to elicit information), he set about their performance.
But as he failed to conduct them in due form, he
not only failed of his purpose, but so roused the anger of
Jupiter, that he struck him with lightning and reduced him
and his whole household to ashes. Livy’s story of Tullus
illustrates well the relation of a Roman to his god: it was
a practical, not a spiritual relation, a bargain, not an act of
grace. If the Roman paid all his dues of worship to the god
he had a claim to repayment in full. Again and again, under
the stress of pestilence, failure of the god to honour his bond
drove the Roman to try his luck with alien gods. This is
the spirit in which Tarquinius Superbus,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> during another
plague, in 514 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, sent his sons to Greek Delphi to inquire
of the god how to be rid of it. Pestilence, in this manner,
was destined to forge many a link in the chain that bound
Rome to Greece.</p>

<p>In the fifth century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus
record a constant succession of plagues in Rome.
Eight visitations, at least, are mentioned, and as some of
these lingered over several years, Rome, in the fifth century,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
can seldom have been free from pestilence. And yet all this
time she was not only growing, but actually sending out
colonies.</p>

<p>Of a plague in 473 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> we have an interesting recital by
Dionysius of Halicarnassus.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> ‘In the beginning of the
year’, he writes, ‘many prodigies and omens happened,
which filled the city with superstition and fear of the gods:
and all the augurs and the interpreters of holy things
declared that these were signs of divine anger, because some
rites had not been performed with sanctity and purity.
Not long after, a distemper, supposed to be pestilential,
attacked the women, particularly such as were with child,
and more of them died than had ever been known before.
For as they miscarried and brought forth dead children,
they died together with their infants. And neither supplications
at the statues and altars of the gods, nor expiatory
sacrifices performed on behalf of the public and of private
families gave the women any relief.’ Thereupon a slave
came forward and denounced Urbinia, one of the Vestal
Virgins, who tended the perpetual fire, for impurity. The
pontiffs at once removed her from her ministry, brought her
to trial, convicted her, and condemned her ‘to be whipped
with rods, to be carried through the city, and buried alive’.
One of her guilty lovers killed himself: the other was ordered
to be publicly whipped like a slave, and then put to death.
After this, ‘the distemper, which had attacked the women
and caused so great a mortality among them, presently
ceased.’ Again, the pestilence is attributed to the imperfect
performance of some detail of ritual, which must be expiated
forthwith, if the sender of the pestilence is to be appeased.
Its special incidence on women seemed to bring home the
guilt to them. It was meet therefore that a woman’s life
should be its expiation. Such is the earliest detailed record
of human sacrifice for deliverance from plague, but we shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
meet it again and again in the history of epidemic pestilence.
Surely the tiger in man is but lightly prisoned in his human
cage.</p>

<p>Human sacrifice was probably world-wide in the earliest
ages of nations. The Phoenicians<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> resorted to it in times of
national calamity, such as epidemic pestilence. There is
abundant evidence from the Bible<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and elsewhere, that
human sacrifice was habitual in primitive Semitic religion.
The Israelites were apt to assert that they learnt these
practices from the peoples whom they superseded in the
land of Canaan, but it must be remembered that they came
of the same stock as these races. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> refers to the
legend of Leos, who is said to have sacrificed his daughters,
at the bidding of the oracle, to save Athens from a famine;
and in speaking of the ruined city of Potniae<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> he says that
the oracle of Delphi told them that they would get rid of
a pestilence only by the sacrifice of a blooming boy to
Dionysus, who had sent it for the murder of his priest. At
the Athenian feast of Thargelia in May, a man and a woman
were led through the city and stoned to death outside its
walls, a man for the men, and a woman for the women: and
a similar practice maintained in the Saturnalia at Rome.
But with the advance of civilization animal substitutes
came to replace the human victims.</p>

<p>Philostratus<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> cites another notable instance of human
sacrifice for deliverance from pestilence. The Ephesians
had summoned Apollonius (first century <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>) to come
and check the plague. On his arrival he at once set himself
to encourage the citizens, and gathered them together to
the theatre ‘where now stands the statue of Averruncus.
Here they found an ill-looking old beggar, whom Apollonius
ordered them to stone to death, as being the enemy of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
gods. As soon as they set to stoning him, fire darted from
the old beggar’s eyes, so that they knew him for a demon.
After they had killed him, Apollonius ordered them to
remove the stones from the corpse, and they found instead
of a human body a fierce dog vomiting foam, as if mad....
The form this dog assumed was like that given to the statue
of Averruncus.’</p>

<p>The blood-lust of panic terror, which found its gratification
in the slaying of Urbinia, is the lineal descendant of the
cold-blooded ritual of human sacrifice: no human passion
is so cruel as fear. But we shall fail to find even this palliation
for the torture and killing of the ‘unctores’, both in Genoa
and Milan, and for the wholesale massacre of Jews at the time
of the Black Death, carried through by legal process far
more deliberate, far more lengthy, far less impassioned
than any rite of human sacrifice.</p>

<p>In the pestilence of 461 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> the mortality was so great
that it became necessary to throw the dead bodies into the
Tiber. Livy<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> says that a cattle epizootic preceded the
epidemic, and that the necessity of admitting the cattle
within the walls, owing to the invasion of Roman territory by
the Aequans and Volscians, increased the malignity of the
distemper. In this crisis of calamities, the Senate ordered the
people to supplicate the protection of the gods. These
‘supplications’ took the form of expiatory processions, and
seem to have been introduced from Greece to Rome. Like
the Salic processions they moved to the sound of music and
singing, as they visited the sanctuaries of the gods, prostrating
themselves before their statues, clasping their knees
and kissing their hands and feet. Livy<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> holds that the
guardian gods and the city’s good fortune saved Rome at
this juncture, as fear of the pestilence induced the enemy
to divert their attack to the richer and healthy Tusculan
territory. Just before this outbreak Livy<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> says that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
sky seemed to be lit up by an exceeding bright light. It is
not clear what celestial phenomenon he has in mind, but it
is noteworthy as perhaps anticipating the fixed belief of
later days in comets, as harbingers of pestilence.</p>

<p>The belief in astral influence over terrestrial phenomena
and on the affairs of humanity was general and dates from
prehistoric times. Hippocrates held that every physician
should be versed in astrology. The dependence of season
on the heavenly bodies, and the seasonal prevalence of
epidemic disease were facts patent to every one, so that
it was seemingly reasonable for the ancients to assert the
influence of the heavenly bodies on disease, though when
pushed to excessive lengths it became absurd. When
pestilence was seldom absent, it must needs at times coincide
with certain conjunctions of planets. How deeply the belief
took root in medicine is shown by the words of the preface
of the German <i>Herbarius</i>,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> first published in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1485.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Many a time and oft have I contemplated inwardly
the wondrous works of the Creator of the universe: how in
the beginning He formed the heavens and adorned them with
goodly, shining stars, to which He gave power and might
to influence everything under heaven. Also how He formed
afterwards the four elements: fire, hot and dry—air, hot
and moist—water, cold and moist—earth, dry and cold—and
gave to each a nature of its own: and how after this
the same Great Master of Nature made and formed herbs
of many sorts and animals of all kinds, and last of all Man,
the noblest of all created things. Thereupon I thought on
the wondrous order, which the Creator gave these same
creatures of His, so that everything, which has its being
under heaven, receives it from the stars, and keeps it by
their help.’</p>

</div>

<p>Dionysius of Halicarnassus<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> records another fearful pestilence
in 451 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, which carried off all the slaves and
half the citizens of Rome. The pollution of the Tiber by
the dead bodies seemed to intensify its ravages. Men and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
cattle perished alike, in and around Rome, and famine
followed, because the land was left untilled. As long as the
people had any hopes in the assistance of their own gods,
they approached them with sacrifices and all manner of
expiation. But when these proved of no avail, they set
themselves to introduce foreign innovations into the established
religion of Rome. We shall see in the succeeding
visitation, in what direction the disillusioned Romans first
cast their eyes.</p>

<p>From 435-430 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> pestilence,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> following on a drought
and cattle epizootic, raged in Rome and the surrounding
country beyond the power of human endurance. Frequent
earthquakes preceded a great access of virulence in 431 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>:
the very powers of nature seemed to have declared war on
Rome. The people offered a general supplication to the
gods, repeating the formulas word for word after the duumvirs,
so that no mistake of word or syllable might invalidate
the office: but in vain. So the worship of Apollo was
brought from Greece to Rome, and a temple erected in his
honour in 431 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Apollo cannot have been a wholly
unfamiliar god, for the Sibylline books must at least have
introduced his name to Rome. But from this time he becomes
naturalized as a leading Roman god. From his
temple, in times of pestilence, expiatory processions paraded
the streets of the city; and as plague succeeds plague, he
supplants step by step the older native gods.</p>

<p>In 395 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> pestilence<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> worked such havoc, that the Senate
ordered the Sibylline books to be consulted. This collection
of oracular utterances in Greek, given forth by inspired
prophetesses or Sibyls (Σίβυλλα = Doric Σιὸς βόλλα =
Διὸς βουλή = will of the god), had found its way from
the Troad to Cumae. Thence Tarquinius Superbus transferred
part to Rome, and laid it up in sacred custody, to be
used by order of the Senate, in times of national emergency.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
As these books recognized the gods and ritual of the Asiatic
Greeks, they played a leading part in the introduction of
Greek gods and Greek ritual into the religion of Rome. On
this occasion the Sibylline books prescribed the celebration
of a <i>lectisternium</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>lectisternium</i>, which now first appeared in Rome, was
a festival of Greek origin. A public banquet of great
magnificence was set before the deities, whose images were
placed on couches. The exhibition of three pairs of alien
gods, Apollo and Latona, Diana and Hercules, Mercury and
Neptune, betrayed its foreign origin. The imaginative
populace saw them accept the food or turn away from it
in anger. Meantime domestic feasts were spread throughout
the city, to which strangers and friends alike, and even
liberated prisoners, came each to have his share. Doors lay
open everywhere, offering a home to every casual comer. All
things were had in common. No sound of discord marred
the perfect peace. The people were admitted to solemn communion
with the gods, as the Greek warriors before Troy
shared with their gods in the eucharistic feast, in token that
the plague was stayed.</p>

<p>Coincidently with this epidemic at Rome, Diodorus Siculus<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
describes with some clinical detail a pestilence that attacked
the Carthaginian army, while besieging Syracuse. The
Lacedaemonians were assisting Dionysius and the Syracusans
against the Carthaginians. The record is of interest as
exhibiting Diodorus in the rôle of a flagrant plagiarist of
Thucydides.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘But as to the Carthaginians, after they had ruined the
suburbs and rifled and plundered the temples of Ceres and
Proserpine, a plague seized upon the army, and to intensify
and sharpen the vengeance of the gods upon them, both
the season of the year and the multitudes of men crowded
together contributed greatly to the aggravation of their
misery: for the summer was hotter than ordinarily, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
locality itself occasioned the distemper to rage beyond all
control. Not long before the Athenians were swept away in
the self-same place by a plague, for it was marshy and low-lying
ground. At the commencement of the distemper,
before the sun rose, their bodies would fall a-shaking and
trembling, through the coldness of the air that came off
the water: but about noon they were stifled with the heat,
because they were pent up so closely together. The south
wind brought in the infection among them, and swept them
away in heaps, but for a while they buried their dead. But
when the number of the dead increased to such an extent
that even those in attendance on the sick were cut off, none
durst approach the infected, for the distemper seemed to
be incurable. For first catarrhs and swellings about the
neck (περὶ τὸν τράχηλον οἰδήματα) were caused by the
stench of the bodies that lay unburied, and by the putrefaction
of the soil. Then followed fever, pain in the muscles
of the spine, heaviness of the limbs, dysentery and pustules
(φλύκταιναι) over the surface of the whole body. The
majority suffered in this manner, but others became raving
mad and forgot everything, and rushing about distracted
struck every one that they met. All the help of the physicians
was in vain, both by reason of the violence of the distemper
and the suddenness with which it carried many off: for in
the midst of terrible suffering they commonly died on the
fifth or at latest the sixth day: so that those who died in
battle were accounted fortunate by all. And it was further
a matter of observation, that all who attended on the sick
died of the same distemper, and what aggravated the misery
was that none would willingly come near the distressed
and exhausted, to minister to them. For not only strangers,
but even brothers and familiar friends were driven by fear
of infection to forsake one another.’</p>

</div>

<p>Diodorus seems to have drawn on the clinical symptoms
of several different diseases, to heighten the effect of his
description. The combination of pustules on the body with
swellings about the neck suggests true plague, but there the
likeness ends. There are other descriptions of pestilence in
Diodorus Siculus, that exhibit this same eclectic tendency.</p>

<p>In 363 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, after one or two intervening milder outbreaks,
another period of pestilence<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> set in in Rome. Plutarch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
says that it carried off a prodigious number of the people,
most of the magistrates and Camillus himself. When all else
failed to appease the gods, scenic plays were imported from
Etruria. Hitherto the Roman people had had only the
games of the circus. Livy describes their introduction to
Rome in minute detail, tracing the development of regular
stage plays from these rude scenic shows. ‘Actors’, he says,
‘were sent for from Etruria, who without any song or imitative
gestures regulated their movements by the measures
of the music, and exhibited in Tuscan fashion by no means
ungraceful dances.’ To the ancients the movements of the
body spoke a language as familiar as the movements of
the tongue. ‘It seemed to me’, he continues, ‘that the first
origin of plays should be noticed, that it might appear how
from a modest beginning they have reached their present
extravagance. However, the first introduction of plays,
intended as a religious expiation, neither relieved their
minds from religious awe, nor their bodies from disease.’
Indeed the Tiber inundated the circus and interrupted
a performance, as though the gods despised their efforts
at atonement. So popular amusement had come at last
to supplant popular atonement, giving birth in the process
to dramatic entertainment. In this respect we shall find
history repeat itself with striking similarity in the plague
times of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Such was the origin and the evolution of the scenic plays
(<i>ludi scenici</i>), introduced in the first place to divert the
mind and distract the spirit from the crushing catastrophe
of pestilence. The visitation was followed by an earthquake,
which is said to have opened a gaping abyss in the Forum,
into which Manlius Curtius hurled himself in full armour—a
willing human scapegoat sacrificed to the angry gods.</p>

<p>When these various measures failed to allay the pestilence,
an old custom of driving a nail into the temple of Jupiter
was solemnly revived. This practice in its inception purposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
to make a calendar of years. But once when a dictator
had driven in the nail, forthwith a pestilence had ceased.
So now it was urged that, if a dictator and no common
magistrate drove in the nail, the pestilence would cease.
So says Livy, but there is abundant evidence, both from
ancient literature and from modern folk-lore, that he has
missed the real significance of the act. We find traces of
a world-wide belief in the possibility of transferring the
evils of the body, as well as the evils of the soul, to some
other being or animal, or thing. The scapegoat is familiar
to all, and we know from Leviticus,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> that at the cleansing
of a leper the Jews let a bird fly away. Pliny<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> too tells us,
that a Roman cure for epilepsy was to drive a nail into the
ground, where the epileptic’s head had struck it on falling:
a similar cure for toothache was practised in France and
Germany, and for ague in Suffolk.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In each instance the
idea was to nail fast the evil thing, and so hinder it from
returning to trouble its former host. A story given by
L. Strackerjan,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and quoted by Frazer, comes even more
closely to the point. During the Thirty Years’ War pestilence
came from Neuenkirchen, in Oldenburg, to a neighbouring
farmhouse in the semblance of a blue vapour, and entering
the house found its way into a hole in the door-post. The
farmer seized a peg and hammered it into the hole, so that
it should not come out. After a time he drew out the peg,
believing the danger was past, but out came the blue
vapour once more. Every member of the unhappy household
fell a victim to the pestilence.</p>

<p>In 348 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> pestilence<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> was again rife, and a <i>lectisternium</i>
was observed at the instance of the Sibylline books.</p>

<p>In 331 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Rome was again in the grip of a devastating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
pestilence.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Numbers of the Senate had already perished
when a female slave came to the aediles and declared that
the victims had died of poison. She would show them
matrons actually engaged in compounding poisons, and a
store laid up in readiness for use. Sure enough, drugs were
found in the possession of two women of patrician rank,
Cornelia and Sergia, and in spite of their protest that these
were harmless, they were compelled to swallow them, and
fell victims to their own nefarious devices. One hundred
and seventy matrons were implicated in their guilt, and
paid the penalty with their lives. Rome offered a human
holocaust to the spirit of panic fear.</p>

<p>The grim suspicion of poison was not now formulated for
the first time, for the Athenians had suspected the Lacedaemonians
of poisoning their wells. But now the charge
appears as a deadly and insidious weapon, ready to the
hand of every infamous or ill-disposed informer. The
hideous catalogue of cruelties inflicted on innocent victims,
under the spell of this illusion, forms a dark chapter in the
history of epidemic pestilence.</p>

<p>In the face of another pestilence<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> in 312 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, a dictator
was again appointed to drive a nail into the temple of Jupiter.</p>

<p>We have seen the succession of Rome’s epidemics almost
unbroken throughout the fourth and fifth centuries. We
are accustomed to think of Roman character as trained in
the school of interminable warfare, but we are apt to forget
that there was another, a sterner and more desolating enemy,
almost always alert within her gates, ‘the pestilence that
walketh in darkness.’ In the perpetual struggle for existence
on the stricken fields of battle and of pestilence, young Rome
had found, as yet, no leisure for the loftier pursuits of the
human intellect, and had developed no literature and no art
of her own, worthy of either name. As Greek and Roman
were alike children of one common stock, some strong abiding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
influences must have been at work, leading development along
widely divergent paths: and perhaps in epidemic pestilence,
with which Greece was but little familiar till the end of the
fifth century at least, we may look for one such agency.</p>

<p>In 295 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, during a fierce pestilence, Livy<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> says that the
consul’s son built a temple to Venus, close to the circus
out of fines inflicted on some matrons convicted of adultery,
as though their sin was believed to be its cause. In the
Middle Ages likewise we shall find many churches built in
commemoration of particular plagues.</p>

<p>Only two years later a violent pestilence<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> drove the
magistrates to consult the Sibylline books, and in obedience
to their instruction ambassadors were sent from Rome to
Epidaurus to demand the serpent of Aesculapius, in which
the god seemed to be incarnate. At first nothing was done
beyond devoting one day to the supplication of Aesculapius.
But in the following year ambassadors set out under the
leadership of Quintus Ogulnius<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and on arrival at Epidaurus
were taken to the temple of Aesculapius, and invited to carry
away whatever was needed to rescue their city from pestilence.
Thereupon the serpent, which rarely appeared to the
Epidaurians, presented itself for three days in the most
public parts of the city, and then of its own accord made
its way to the Roman galley, in which it was transported
to Antium, after the ambassadors had been instructed how
to pay honour to the god. After a brief sojourn there it
re-entered the Roman galley, and scarce had they reached
the Tiber, when it swam to the island in mid-stream,
where a temple was dedicated afterwards to Aesculapius. A
coin of Commodus<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> and a medallion of Antoninus (see Plate I,
p. 4) survive to commemorate the event. To this day
there may be seen on some large blocks of stone, moulded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
to the shape of the poop of a ship, on the Isola Tiberina,
the head of an effigy of Aesculapius in relief, with the serpent
twined round his staff.</p>

<p>So it was pestilence that brought Aesculapius to Rome, as
it had brought Apollo before him. In this temple in the
Tiber the healing ritual of the god flourished for some
centuries, and in recent excavations many votive emblems
of diseased parts of the body have been brought to light.
With few intervals, and those of no long duration, the island
has been dedicated to works of healing down to the present
day. Claudius ordained that sick slaves should be exposed
on the island, and those that recovered were to receive their
freedom. The hospital of S. Giovanni Calabita, founded in
1575, stands there still. In 1656 the whole island was converted
into a lazaretto for the victims of the plague.</p>

<p>It was the constant custom of the priests of Epidaurus, in
founding a new shrine to send out one of the sacred snakes
from the sanctuary. Pausanias<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> describes the coming of
Aesculapius from Epidaurus to Sicyon, in the form of a snake,
in a car drawn by a pair of mules.</p>

<p>Before his transference to Rome, Aesculapius had already
attained all the attributes of divinity. He had ceased to
be a mere god-man by the time that his worship reached
Athens from Epidaurus (420 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>). So far was his serpent
origin forgotten, that the Greeks explained his association
with the serpent by the suggestion that medicine, like the
serpent, reappeared annually in a fresh integument.</p>

<p>In computing the number of epidemics that visited Rome
Livy is the chief authority, and in doing so it must be borne
in mind that his work is incomplete. Epitomes only
survive of the books dealing with the years from 293 to
219 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, and of those again from 167 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> to the end of his
history in the middle of the reign of Augustus. That there
was no cessation of the frequent recurrence of pestilence may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
reasonably be inferred from the regularity of appearance in
those intervening years, of which his complete histories survive.</p>

<p>In 212 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Livy<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> describes simultaneous pestilence at
Syracuse and at Rome. The Roman general, Marcellus,
was besieging Syracuse, when pestilence fell both on besiegers
and besieged. The Carthaginian and Sicilian armies, however,
suffered more than the Romans, who retired within
the walls to recruit their health. The Sicilians also shook
it off by dispersing to their cities, but it continued to rage
among the Carthaginians, who had no place to which to
retire. Livy’s description of the neglect of the dead recalls
that of Thucydides, but the similarity of expression is not
so close as to make it certain that he has borrowed directly
from Thucydides. He writes: ‘At last their feelings had
become so completely brutalized by being habituated to
these miseries, that they not only did not follow their dead
with tears and decent lamentations, but they did not even
carry them out and bury them: so that the bodies of the
dead lay strewn about, exposed to the view of those who
were awaiting a similar fate. And thus the dead were the
means of destroying the sick, and the sick those who were
in health, both by fear and by the filthy state and the noisome
stench of their bodies. Some, preferring to die by the
sword, even rushed upon the outposts of the enemy.’ Livy
might well have been describing the scenes in the streets
of Marseilles during the plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1720. Silius Italicus<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
has described this pestilence, as well as Livy, but his is
a mere poetic picture of its fancied incidence first on dogs,
next on birds, then on wild beasts, and finally on man.</p>

<p>The Ludi Apollinares also were instituted in 212 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, but
Livy states that they were instituted in commemoration of the
victory in arms, and not because of the restoration of a state
of healthiness, as is commonly supposed. In the circumstances
the one proposition need hardly exclude the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>For three full years, from 183 to 180 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, pestilence<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
raged in Rome, carrying off both high and low. The people
saw in it a sign of celestial anger, and the Pontifex Maximus
ordered that the Sibylline books should be consulted. Gilded
statues and offerings were duly vowed to the healing deities,
Apollo, Aesculapius, and Hygieia, who for long years in the
person of Athena had stood as protectress of the health of
Athens. Pestilence had now brought her to Rome. A
supplication was celebrated in town and surrounding
country by all above the age of twelve, the suppliants
wearing chaplets on their heads and carrying in their hands
boughs of the laurel, sacred to Apollo. Suspicions of poison
were freely bruited in the city, and Valerius of Antium says
that an investigation actually resulted in the condemnation
of two thousand persons, and among them Quarta Hostilia,
wife of the consul who had died of the pestilence. So splendid
an atonement must needs appease the angered gods.</p>

<p>In 176-175 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> pestilence was again severe in Rome.
Livy’s<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> account of it is interesting, because he states that,
in spite of the great mortality among cattle and men,
there were no vultures to be seen in either year of the
pestilence. Taking the observation in its context it reads as
though the vultures were the first to suffer, so that they
were exterminated locally, then the cattle, and afterwards
man, and with him probably his dog. Thucydides had
already drawn attention to the absence of vultures during
the plague of Athens, and with the passage of years the
observation crystallized into an article of faith pertinent
to all and every pestilence. In the case of the plague of
Aleppo Russell definitely negatives the observation.</p>

<p>With the conclusion of Livy’s history we enter on a barren
period in the history of Roman pestilence, and we may turn
for a while to some aspects of pestilence presented by
ancient Latin poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</h2>

</div>

<p>Into his great poem ‘On the Nature of Things’ (<i>De
Rerum Natura</i>) Lucretius has grafted a description of the
plague of Athens, converting the record of Thucydides into
Latin hexameter verse. His prime motive in its introduction
is to show that the chief phenomena of nature, and pestilence
as one of these, all harmonize with the atomic theory, that
he has adopted from Democritus and Epicurus. Lucretius
indeed propounds an atomic explanation of pestilence,
consonant in its main features with the doctrines of his
contemporary Asclepiades. We can reason of the imperceptible,
he argues, only from our knowledge of the perceptible.
Our eyes see clouds descend from the sky, and noxious
vapours rise as mists from the land. Our minds then may
not unreasonably infer, that pestilence also either comes
down from heaven by the medium of clouds, or rises up from
the rain-sodden earth by the medium of mist. In each
manner the atmosphere becomes impregnated with noxious
atoms that distemper it. These particles enter our bodies,
either by the air we breathe, or by the food and drink they
have contaminated, and thus provoke infection. Such, he
holds, was the cause of the plague of Athens.</p>

<p>The views of Lucretius as to the proximate causes of
pestilence are almost identical with those of his contemporary,
Diodorus Siculus. With each of them moisture,
as cloud or mist, distempers the air or damages food, and so
finds entry into lungs or stomach. With each an ill wind
may engender pestilence: with Lucretius, by bringing a
harmful to replace a beneficent atmosphere: with Diodorus
Siculus, by failing to cool the air to an appropriate temperature,
thus causing fever. To Lucretius clouds, mists, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
winds are carriers of noxious particles. In this atomic
theory of infection he faintly foreshadows the doctrine of
particulate poisons, that held the field of scientific speculation
within the memory of living men. But even so Lucretius
came less near the truth than his great contemporary
Varro,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> who actually ascribes disease in animals to living
organisms beyond the range of human vision (‘crescunt
animalia quaedam minuta, quae non possunt oculi consequi,
et per aera, intus per os ac nares perveniunt atque efficiunt
difficiles morbos’).</p>

<p>To Lucretius pestilence is a purely natural process, in
which there is no place for the handiwork of gods. Of this
theme, in varying applications, he is a fierce exponent
throughout the length and breadth of his poem. Perhaps
it is for this reason that he chose the narrative of Thucydides
as the basis of his poem, for Thucydides, too, referred epidemic
pestilence to natural causation, not to the special act of any
god. Like Thucydides, too, Lucretius accepts without
reserve the doctrine of contagion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Qui fuerant autem praesto contagibus ibant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Atque labore.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">(Those who had stayed near at hand would die of contagion
and the toil.)</p>

<p>Pestilence, too, affords Lucretius a rare text for the exposure
of the hollow sham of state-worship, which represented now
all that survived of religion in Rome. We have seen how
much of Roman religion had its origin from time to time in
the necessity of exorcising pestilence: and we have seen how
popular superstition revivified the ritual of popular atonement.
Now the Sibylline books are consulted. Now a nail
is driven into the temple of Jupiter. Now Apollo is brought to
Rome, and a temple erected in his honour. Now Aesculapius
comes in the form of a serpent to deliver Rome: now
Hygieia. Now sacrifices are offered and feasts set out before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
the statues of the gods. This is the fabric that Lucretius,
fired with iconoclastic zeal, would fain demolish, not as the
enemy of religion, but as the ruthless enemy of religious
sham.</p>

<p>In literary form this part of the great Lucretian poem
falls far below the rest. The poem as a whole possesses
a rugged grandeur of its own, but this terminal portion,
while retaining all the ruggedness, has lost most of the
grandeur. It gives the impression of having been merely
rough cast, to await the polishing, which, owing to the
premature death of the poet in 55 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, it never received.
Fault also may be found with the literary substance, for in
places he misunderstands the language of Thucydides, and
misrepresents his meaning. Again, he incorporates here and
there fragments of Hippocrates and fancies of his own into
the record of Thucydides, as though all disease presented
a single clinical facies. For example, he reproduces as <i>cor</i>
the καρδία of Thucydides, which the latter used, as did
Hippocrates, for the cardiac end of the stomach. Again, he
misinterprets Thucydides with regard to the effect of the
disease on the extremities. He represents στερισκόμενοι
τούτων as <i>ferro privati</i>, whereas clearly Thucydides means
that the parts sloughed off, not that they were amputated.
It would seem that Lucretius was versed in the Greek language
of his day, but that language was no longer the Greek of
Thucydides and Plato. Nor does Lucretius scorn the full
licence that Horace accords to the poet, and exigencies of
metre sometimes compel him not to adhere strictly to his
model: thus he transforms the critical days into the eighth
and ninth. One long passage beginning</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Multaque praeterea mortis tum signa dabantur</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">consists of various excerpts from Hippocrates turned into
Latin verse. These are gathered from such diverse parts
of the Hippocratic writings, as to indicate considerable
acquaintance with them. The lineaments of the Hippocratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
facies are reproduced in detail. The fact is that Lucretius was
more anxious for the picturesqueness than for the accuracy
of his description, provided always that the logical soundness
of the main thesis and its didactic purpose were not compromised
thereby.</p>

<p>In his picture of the mythical plague that afflicted the
people of Aegina, Ovid<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> exacts contributions alike from
Thucydides, Lucretius, and Vergil, while there are certain
features that bear a strong resemblance to Diodorus Siculus.
His story is that Minos, King of Crete, the second king of
the name, goes in quest of allies to the island of Aegina, and
courts unsuccessfully the aid of its king Aeacus. As soon
as he has departed, Cephalus comes as ambassador from
Athens and obtains help from Aeacus, who gives him an
account of the pestilence that had formerly raged in Aegina,
and dwells on its marvellous repeopling. Ovid maintains
sufficient independence of his models for us to be able to
gather something at least of current ideas of pestilence, set
though it is in an atmosphere of antiquity. At first the
disease was referred to natural causation and so was combated
by medicines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Dum visum mortale malum tantaeque latebat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Causa nocens cladis, pugnatum est arte medendi.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Exitium superabat opem, quae victa iacebat.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The tendency was now to regard pestilence as a natural
process, until it overstepped habitual limitations, and
triumphantly defied the resources of orthodox medicine.
Then popular imagination saw in it the hand of a god, and
forthwith set it outside the confines of recognized pathology.
So now Ovid ascribes the Aeginetan plague to the anger
of Juno, because the island was named after her adulterous
rival Aegina, who was carried there by Jupiter, and by him
became the mother of Aeacus, King of Aegina. But side
by side with this Ovid lays stress on various meteorological<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
phenomena, that accompanied or preluded the pestilence—the
earth encompassed with gross darkness, a drowsy heat
in the clouds, and persistent hot winds, as though he believed
in some close causal connexion. He conceives the virus to
be communicable in water, for fountains and lakes were
deemed to be infected, and the rivers tainted with the
venom of innumerable snakes. He dwells at length on the
epizootic, and elaborates this feature far more even than
Livy, and true to the habitual character of Roman pestilence,
he makes it precede the human epidemic. He holds fast the
doctrine of contagion, which he conceives to be transmitted
by the dead as well as the living. Ovid’s description of
pestilence unmasks his shallow nature. He shows himself
to be no more and no less than an elegant literary trifler.
One feels in the easy flow of his verse and the light vagaries
of his picturesque imagination an unconcern and indifference
to the horrible realities he handles. He has no power, like
Thucydides, to plumb the depths of pathos, and the reader
turns from his catalogue of sufferings with no emotion of
horror, still less with one of sympathy. One looks in vain
for some vestige of the moral earnestness of Lucretius. Even
for his deities the springs of action reside in the lowlier
human passions. Caprice and jealousy move Juno to send the
pestilence: humanity is the sport of these infirmities. When
man’s conception of Divine Providence had sunk so low, it
was well that Imperial Rome should be without religion.</p>

<p>Manilius, in his <i>Astronomica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> composed about the Christian
era, asserts with confidence, that comets presage pestilence.
The belief is probably far older than Manilius, though it is
difficult to cite exact authorities. Livy<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> speaks of a bright
light in the sky before the plague of 462 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>; ‘coelum
ardere visum est plurimo igni’: and Dionysius of Halicarnassus<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
recounts the lighting up of a fire in the heavens
before that of 450 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>: ἐν οὐρανῷ σέλα φερόμενα καὶ πυρὸς<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
ἀνάψεις. Allusions such as these would seem to signify
the appearance of a comet. Vergil<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> is even more explicit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Non secus ac liquida si quando nocte cometae</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sanguinei lugubre rubent, aut Sirius ardor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus aegris</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nascitur, et laevo contristat lumine coelum.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of their supposed malign influence on human affairs in
general there is no doubt. Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> assigns to them even
a political significance, for he says that in popular opinion
they always portend a revolution to kingdoms.</p>

<p>Seneca,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in his <i>Physical Science</i>, makes the specific statement
that ‘after great earthquakes it is usual for a pestilence
to occur’. The concurrence of the two had been mentioned
previously by Thucydides, Diodorus Siculus, Livy, and others,
but Seneca would seem to be the first to attempt to define
the exact relation of the one to the other. In the Campanian
earthquake of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 63 a flock of 600 sheep had perished
mysteriously, near Pompeii. Seneca conceives that earthquakes
liberate poisonous fumes imprisoned in the earth,
or pent up in marshes, which serve to taint the air. Flocks
suffer most, he thinks, because they live in the open, and
also drink the poison-laden water. They feed too with heads
close to the ground and so receive the concentrated venom,
before it has become diluted: and then he adds: ‘If it
had issued in greater volume, it would have injured man too,
but the abundant supply of pure air counteracted it, before
it could rise high enough to be breathed by any human
being.’ And he proceeds: ‘The better is ever conquered by
the worse. Even that pure air of heaven changes then to
pestilential. Thence come sudden and continuous deaths,
and portentous forms of disease, that spring from unexampled
causes. The disaster is long- or short-lived according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
to the strength of the sources of infection. Nor does the
plague cease, until the freedom of heaven and the tossing
of the winds have banished that fatal air.’</p>

<p>Seneca had probably stumbled on the true explanation of
the death of the Campanian sheep, for Geikie says that after
an eruption of Mount Vesuvius the escape of carbonic acid
gas has been known to suffocate hundreds of hares, partridges,
and pheasants. Seneca, in conformity with the
learned opinion of his time, regards volcanoes and earthquakes
as closely allied phenomena. Earthquakes were
regarded as the product in the main of violent commotion
of the air. Niebuhr, like Seneca, expressed a firm belief in
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as causes of pestilence,
a thesis that many writers have sought to substantiate.
It is tempting, even to-day, to speculate on migrations
of rats set in motion by subterranean activity. But a careful
survey of a sufficient series of earthquakes and plagues
lends little support to such a proposition. Each may occur
alike before or after, with or without the other, and their
frequent concurrence in ancient history denotes no more
than that the eyes of historians were focused, almost
exclusively, on a narrow tract of land around the shores
of the Mediterranean, in which earthquakes were and are
notoriously of frequent occurrence. Two years after the great
earthquake Campania was devastated by a hurricane, and
Rome desolated by pestilence. Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> says that the
pestilence swept away ‘all classes of human beings without
any such derangement of the atmosphere as to be visibly
apparent. Yet the houses were filled with dead bodies and
the streets with funerals.’ Tacitus declares unhesitatingly
for the production of pestilence by natural and not by
supernatural agency.</p>

<p>The year <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 79 is ever memorable for the destruction
of Herculaneum and Pompeii. It was followed by pestilence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
which Dion Cassius attributes to ashes from Vesuvius.
Dust had been suspect from the remotest ages of antiquity.
At the time of the Exodus Moses was told to sprinkle dust
before heaven. ‘And it shall become dust in all the land
of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon
man.’ Livy and Plutarch each attributed the plague that
broke out among the Gauls, when besieging Rome under
Brennus, to the dust and ashes of the houses they had burnt.
Philo, too, ascribes a pestilence of about the year <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 92
to hot dust irritating the skin.</p>

<p>Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> mentions a plague that broke out in the
reign of Domitian (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 81-96), and which may be the same
as that mentioned by Philo. ‘Certain individuals’, he says,
‘poisoned needles and set to work to prick whomsoever
they wished: several who were pricked died without
knowing anything about it: but some of the scoundrels
were denounced and punished; and that happened not
only in Rome, but over all the world so to say.’ Some
initial punctiform eruption may perhaps have simulated
a needle-prick. Belief in the dissemination of pestilence
by the cutaneous inoculation of poison was destined
to flourish for many centuries. Dion Cassius<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> himself
repeats the statement in the case of another pestilence
in the reign of Commodus (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 187): ‘In the
reign of Commodus occurred the most violent sickness
I have ever known: at Rome two thousand persons often
died in a single day. But many died, not only in Rome, but
in all parts of the empire, in another manner: scoundrels,
poisoning little needles with certain noxious substances,
transmitted the disease in this way for pay: this had been
done already in the reign of Domitian.’ For three years
then famine and pestilence worked hand in hand to ruin
Rome, and the people in their fury clamoured for a victim.
A pleasant sacrifice was handy in the Phrygian freedman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Cleander, the greedy and infamous minister of Commodus.
It was eagerly bruited that Cleander had hoarded wheat,
and the maddened populace, surging to the palace of
Commodus, clamoured for the head of the hated favourite.
The Emperor, fearful for his own life, at the instance of the
women of his court demanded that the head of Cleander
should be thrown from the palace to the people. The spectacle
of this bloody expiation appeased the fury of the rabble.
On the advice of his physicians<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Commodus himself beat
a hasty retreat to Laurentum, to seek an antidote in the
scent of its abundant laurels. Those who remained in
Rome filled their noses and ears with sweet ointments, to
neutralize the pestilential exhalations from infected bodies
and from the contagious atmosphere. At last a Roman
emperor is found, in presence of pestilence, consulting—not
the Sibylline books, not the oracle, not the omens—but
a physician, and obeying his instruction. Medicine
has tardily come into her own, and Pliny’s sarcasm, that
Rome prospered for 600 years without physicians, has lost
its sting. But we shall see presently that the hour for
professional exaltation is not yet.</p>

<p>The great Antonine plague—the long plague, as Galen
calls it, for it lasted no less than fifteen years<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>—was brought
to Rome from the East by the Syrian army of Verus, about
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 165. Ammianus Marcellinus<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> sets its commencement
in the sacrilegious folly of some Roman soldiers at the sack
of the city of Seleucia. These men wrenched from its site
a statue of Apollo, and from a narrow aperture beneath its
pedestal the pestilence escaped, carrying death wherever
it went. Julius Capitolinus (<i>c.</i> <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 300) confirms the statement
of Ammianus Marcellinus, except in that he traces
the source of origin to a small golden coffer in this same
temple of Apollo. Carried thence by the victorious army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
to Rome, it found there conditions favourable to its propagation
in an already existing famine, in the accumulation
of the soldiery, and in the concourse of spectators, who had
come to see the triumph of the joint emperors duly celebrated.
Of the mortality at Rome no figures exist, but it is said to
have been very great. Dead bodies were so numerous, that
they were carried to burial heaped up in carts. Aurelius<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
paid the dead the tribute of a public funeral, and erected
statues to the memory of many men of high estate. His
philosophy, though proof against religious belief, showed
itself not proof against religious superstition. The whole
pagan ritual of expiation was paraded on behalf of the distracted
city. The neglected worship of the gods was revived
with renewed vigour, and the aid of those most powerful to
help in such circumstances was eagerly invoked. A lustration
was solemnly performed for the purification of the city, and
a <i>lectisternium</i> celebrated for seven whole days. The people
were readily infected with the contagion of their sovereign’s
superstition, and from this time may be dated a brief revival
of the worship of the effete pagan deities. Aurelius sought
even to appease the anger of the national gods by a persecution
of the Christians, whose religion was an insult to their
majesty. The Christian chronicler, Orosius,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> attributes the
pestilence actually to the persecution of the Christians that
had broken out in Asia and Gaul before its commencement.
All that is known for certain is, that such a persecution was
a consequence, if not a cause as well. An engraved blood-coloured
jasper, preserved in Paris, and figured in the <i>Histoire
de l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</i>, survives to
commemorate the sacrifices by which Marcus Aurelius sought
to charm away the plague. Duruy<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> describes its features:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Marcus Aurelius as sovereign pontiff: on his veiled
head a globe, symbol of his sovereign power: behind him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
an augur’s staff: facing the Emperor Rome helmeted and
Aesculapius with horns: under Aurelius, Hygieia or Health:
lastly the head of Faustina. The Sagittarius, who occupies
the centre, marks the time of the sacrifices, offered in
November or December.’</p>

</div>

<p>Some have inferred from a passage of Julius Capitolinus
that Marcus Aurelius himself died of this pestilence in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
180. In describing his death-bed, Capitolinus says that he
took a hasty farewell of his son, for fear of communicating
his malady to him.</p>

<p>Niebuhr considers that the ancient world never recovered
from the havoc of this pestilence. To it he traces the
decadence of Roman literature and art in the years that
followed, and points to analogous results in Greece from
the plague of Athens, and in early German and early
Florentine literature from the Black Death of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348.
But the seeds of decay in the empire of Rome had already
been sown, as they had been in the empire of Athens before
the Peloponnesian War. Pericles himself had warned the
Athenians at the outset of the far-reaching consequences
of failure. We shall see too hereafter that in the case of
the early Florentine literature other more potent influences
than pestilence were concerned in its temporary effacement.
The lesson to be learnt from a comprehensive survey of
the history of pestilence would seem rather to be this, that
with the community, as with the individual, the sound
constitution throws off the effects of a sickness that strikes
right home, when the resisting power is impaired. Such was
assuredly the case with the interminable sequence of plagues
that assailed Rome in adolescence as well as in adult life.
But as decadence and decrepitude beset the body politic,
the wounds of pestilence went deeper and left abiding scars.</p>

<p>The Antonine plague bequeathed one ill-starred legacy
to the profession of medicine. Every sovereign has the
physicians he deserves, and Galen was physician to Marcus
Aurelius. At the first onset of the pestilence Galen made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
off to Campania, and finding no safety there took ship
to Pergamus. Thence, after two years’ absence, he returned
at the summons of the emperors, and after a brief stay in
Rome joined them at Aquileia, where pestilence tracked
him down again.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Courage, however, and medical acumen are by no means
constant companions, and for many centuries, in face of
pestilence, physicians, and among them Morgagni and
Sydenham, were doomed to follow the example of Galen
as faithfully as they cherished his precepts.</p>

<p>Galen has been regarded generally as the leading authority
on the medical aspects of the Antonine plague, but the value
of Galen’s testimony is not enhanced by the investigation
of these attendant circumstances. The physician who
takes flight at the outset is little likely subsequently to
observe the disease carefully, constantly, and at close
quarters: nor is it surprising to find that much of his
symptomatology is borrowed directly either from Thucydides
or Hippocrates. The striking picture of Thucydides must
needs dominate the mind of the man who studies medicine
in his arm-chair, so that we are prepared to find Galen
asserting the identity of the Antonine pestilence with the
plague of Athens. Here and there passages are lifted almost
<i>verbatim</i> from Thucydides. For example, Galen<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> says that
the sick man’s body did not seem hotter than normal to
the touch, but that he suffered an intolerable inward
burning. The skin was not yellow, but reddish and livid.
The transference of οὔτε χλωρόν from Thucydides shows
that he is copying Thucydides, and is not describing what he
himself saw. Again, the description of the eruption, though
far more precise and complete than that by Thucydides,
shows his influence closely, and now and again falls into his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
actual words, as in ἐξήνθησεν ἕλκεσιν ὅλον τὸ σῶμα. The
same also is true of the more general symptoms<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> of the
disease, such as the insistence on the characteristic appearance
of the inflamed eyes, and the redness of mouth, tongue,
and fauces.</p>

<p>There is the ring of the charlatan, too, in Galen’s use and
advocacy of Armenian bole as an antipestilential specific,
in striking contrast to the crude disavowal of all remedies
by Thucydides. Galen<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> says that ‘all those who used it
were promptly cured’—one wonders at Galen’s flight—‘those
who felt no effect from it died: no other remedy
could replace it’—and then he sublimely concludes, ‘that
those, with whom the remedy failed, were incurable.’ This
Armenian bole was merely an argillaceous earth brought
from Persia and Armenia, which owed its red colour to oxide
of iron. Galen used it as an astringent for wounds and
ulcers before he vaunted it as a specific for pestilence.
Internally, at any rate, it must have been almost inert
in medicinal doses, and as Galen adduces no evidence in
support of his crude dictum, we need be at no pains to justify
our incredulity.</p>

<p>There is reason to think that the Antonine plague was not
one and the same disease throughout its course. Had it
been so, we should have expected from Galen something
in the nature of a single clinical picture, rather than casual
references scattered throughout his voluminous writings.</p>

<p>In describing the character of the eruption and its transformations,
Galen<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> certainly seems to have small-pox in
mind. At a certain stage the eruption broke out all over
the body in the form of ἐξανθήματα μέλανα (a dark efflorescence),
probably of haemorrhagic type. When it ulcerated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
a crust (ἐφελκίς) formed on the surface, which became
detached, and then everything proceeded to a cure. A scar
remained after the separation of the crust, comparable to
the ‘pitting’ of small-pox. In some cases ulceration did
not occur, but the exanthem was rough and scaly and became
detached like a skin: in this condition all got well. Galen
gives some indication of the course of the disease in one who
recovered. ‘A young man on the ninth day had his whole
body covered with ulcers, as had most of those who recovered.
Then he was seized with a cough, and three days after the
ninth he was in a condition to go into the country for convalescence.’
The day after the cough set in, he expelled
during a paroxysm of coughing a crust just like those of
the cutaneous ulcers. Galen had previously examined his
mouth and fauces, and had detected no signs of ulceration.
He could also swallow both liquids and solids without any
difficulty. To determine whether the crust came from his
gullet or no, Galen administered a draught of vinegar and
mustard; and from the absence of pain attending this
drastic procedure he concluded that it must have come from
the larynx and not from the gullet. Destructive ulcerations
of the larynx have been recorded in rare instances in the
course of small-pox, but such a condition would certainly
preclude a journey to the country after the lapse of two days.
It would be less impossible after the expulsion of a diphtheritic
membrane.</p>

<p>It would be unprofitable to follow Galen further into the
features of the pestilential fever he details, for, as we have
said, it is quite uncertain that these are the features of a single
disease. Indeed, apart from the evidence of Galen’s writings,
it would be reasonable to presume the reverse from such
knowledge as we have of other prolonged periods of pestilence.</p>

<p>Before leaving Galen we may say that he postulates
a dual causation of pestilence: on the one hand, great
irregularity of the seasons inducing a pestilential state of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
the atmosphere: on the other, a vitiated condition of the
human body, due to contaminated food, rendering it liable
to fever from very slight causes. The atmospheric factor,
no doubt, would seem to be confirmed by the universality
of the disease, while the greater severity of the disease and
perhaps its special incidence as well among the ill-fed and
destitute would seem to incriminate the resisting power of
the individual.</p>

<p>The plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 252, during the joint imperialty of
Gallus and Hostilian, rivalled the Antonine pestilence both
in virulence and duration. Hostilian was one of the first
victims, though his death was commonly ascribed to the
hand of Gallus. Eusebius<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> says that the disease had
already worked havoc in Alexandria and Egypt, before it
reached Rome. In some cities of Rome and Greece the daily
mortality rose as high as 5,000,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and with greater or less
virulence the disease spread over the whole known world.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
Eusebius attributes the pestilence to moulds deposited from
the air, a belief that we shall meet again in the course of the
Great Plague of London.</p>

<p>Cyprian, the Christian bishop of Carthage, has left us
some details of the symptoms in his eloquent homily
‘De Mortalitate’, which St. Augustine admired so greatly.
Eusebius and Cyprian are both intent on extolling the self-sacrificing
zeal with which the Christians laid down their
lives in the service of the sick. Their writings help us to
appreciate the contempt of suffering generated in the mind
of the early enthusiasts of Christianity by living perpetually
in the presence of persecution and in the fear of death. We
know from the manner in which Cyprian<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> yielded himself
to the sword of the executioner that the spirit of the
‘Sermo de Mortalitate’ permeated his whole being. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
this sermon we may still read the glowing appeal of Cyprian
to his hearers to seek courage and consolation in repentance
for their sins.</p>

<p>Cedrenus<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> was so impressed with the infectiveness of the
disease that he believed it might be communicated by
a look, as Plato had conceived to be true of ophthalmia.
Trebellius Pollio<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> recounts the association of terrestrial
and other portents. Volcanoes awoke to fresh activity:
earthquakes occurred and rumblings of the earth were
heard: the sky was darkened for days: chasms yawned
in the ground: great tidal waves overwhelmed many cities.
It seemed as though the end of the world, foretold by the
Christians, was at hand. In Rome the Sibylline books were
consulted, and they prescribed the easy atonement of a
sacrifice to Jupiter Salutaris.</p>

<p>Eusebius<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> is the chief authority for the pestilence of
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 302, during the reign of Maximian. It was accompanied
by famine, so that the people were reduced to eating grass,
and as many died of starvation as of disease. The famished
dogs fought over the corpses of the dead, and the people
slaughtered them wholesale, lest they should go mad and
attack the living.</p>

<p>Until recent years it was generally believed that
no certain record of bubonic plague existed prior to
that of Procopius (<i>c.</i> <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 490-560). It would seem to be
necessary to revise this opinion in the face of a fragment
of the writings of Rufus of Ephesus, preserved by Oribasius,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
the Christian physician of the Emperor Julian (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 355-63).
He writes: ‘The buboes called pestilential are most fatal
and acute, especially those that are seen occurring about
Libya, Egypt, and Syria, and which are mentioned by
Dionysius Curtus. Dioscorides and Posidonius make much
mention of them in the plague, which occurred in their time
in Libya: they say it was accompanied by acute fever,
pain, and prostration of the whole body, delirium, and
<i>the appearance of large and hard buboes</i>, which did not suppurate,
not only in the accustomed parts, but also in the
groins and armpits:’ and further: ‘One can foresee an
approaching plague by paying attention to the ill condition
of the seasons, to the mode of living less conducive
to health, and to the death of animals that precedes its
invasion.’</p>

<p>Rufus is believed to have flourished in the reign of Trajan
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 98-117), and may have been his physician. Dioscorides
and Posidonius were probably Alexandrine physicians who
flourished soon after the Christian era. The identity of
Dionysius Curtus is conjectural, but there is some reason to
think that he practised medicine in Alexandria in the third
century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Accepting these dates, one must admit that
the evidence for the existence of bubonic plague in epidemic
form in northern Africa and the Levant as early as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
third century <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> is exceedingly strong. Even if we conceive
buboes to have been more common than nowadays
in the course of other acute infectious diseases, the above
record can hardly denote anything but bubonic plague.
The reference to buboes as occurring with greater frequency
in other parts than the groins and armpits does not appear
to have received from medical writers the attention it
deserves.</p>

<p>We have already adduced evidence to show that
Hippocrates also was familiar with bubonic plague in its
sporadic, but probably not in its epidemic form. Galen,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
too, discusses the relation of buboes to fever in such
a manner as to show that he also was acquainted with a
severe bubonic malady, distinct from ordinary septic
buboes. Oribasius also is cognizant of bubonic fevers,
but it may be asserted generally that neither Galen nor
Oribasius shows any signs of knowing them as a prevalent
epidemic pestilence. We may, then, justly say that the
narrative of Procopius affords the first unequivocal description
of an epidemic of bubonic plague.</p>

<p>According to Procopius<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> the plague began at the ill-starred
Pelusium, spreading in one direction through Alexandria
and Egypt, in another through Palestine, and thence
throughout the world, which would have meant to him
from the eastern limits of Persia as far westward as the
shores of the Atlantic. In the light of modern knowledge
it is probable that Pelusium was no more than a distributing
centre <i>en route</i>, and that the true focus of origin lay much
further back along the commercial highways to the east or
south. Of its pandemic character, however, we have the
fullest confirmation in a succession of historical records.
Evagrius<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> says that its total duration was fifty-two years,
and this also it is possible to substantiate from the annexed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>

for each locality.</p>

<p>Procopius describes the plague as progressing by definite
stages, expending its virulence on one country before
passing to another, as though intent on overlooking nothing.
Indeed, if at first it touched a place lightly, it always returned
to it subsequently, till the full measure of punishment was
exacted. Always beginning at the sea-coast it spread into the
interior, so that the infection in the first place was clearly
sea-borne. He states that it took over a year to reach
Byzantium, where it made its appearance in the spring of
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 542. We know, however, from Evagrius that plague
was already in Antioch in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 540, earlier, therefore, than
the date of its alleged appearance in Pelusium.</p>

<p>In his discussion of etiology Procopius borrows much of
the phraseology of Thucydides, but neither here nor elsewhere
does he show the least sign of being influenced by the
substance of the Thucydidean narrative. Thucydides, it
will be remembered, evidently attributed the plague of
Athens to natural causes, declining to speculate as to what
could have produced such a disturbance of nature (μεταβολή).</p>

<p>Procopius says that those who pretended to knowledge
ascribed the pestilence to things darting down from heaven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
(τοῖς ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἐπισκήπτουσιν). This is indeed harking
back to primitive conceptions. But he adds that they do
so without a fragment of evidence, merely for the sake of
deceiving, ascribing to nature what is clearly the handiwork
of God and nothing else. This opinion he bases on the
ground that the plague did not confine its ravages to any
single country nor fall specially on either sex or any age,
but spread over the whole world, regardless of season and
of differences of habit. The argument, in so far as it was
negative, was certainly a strong one in the light of the
medical knowledge of his time, which referred much of the
distinction of different maladies to variations of climate,
soil, season, habit, and other accidental circumstances.
Visual and auditory hallucinations were not lacking. Procopius
says that many that were stricken by the plague saw,
either when awake or when asleep, visions of spirits arrayed
in human forms. Some seemed to hear in their sleep a voice
saying that they were enrolled in the number of the dead.
They fancied that these spectres in human form struck them
in some part of the body, and immediately they were seized
with the disease. To avoid these demons some shut themselves
up in their houses and would not come out on any
account. Others tried to escape the demons by invoking
that the most sacred names and by every form of expiation.</p>

<p>This idea of pestilential demons seems to be of oriental
origin. We have already encountered it in the story of
Apollonius of Tyana at Ephesus. It figures in early Indian
medicine, and also in Mahometan lore. Mahomet seems to
have adopted it directly from Magian tradition, as embodied
by Zoroaster in the Zendavesta. The Magians conceived
one supreme God and Creator of the universe, from whom
also emanated two active principles, personified as Ormusd,
the principle or angel of light or good, and Ahriman, the
principle or angel of darkness or evil, a demon. From these
two opposite principles the universe was compounded, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
in the direction of its affairs these two conflicting elements
were always striving for mastery. So long as the angel of
light was in the ascendant it was well with the affairs of
men; but if for a while the demon of darkness prevailed,
then sorrow and suffering and sin were the lot of mortal man.
It was inevitable that a shepherd race, tending their flocks
beneath a star-lit sky in the plains of Arabia and the uplands
of Central Asia should see in the light and the darkness
two hostile personalities dominating their existence for
better or for worse.</p>

<p>Mahometans believed that spirits were sent by God
armed with bows and arrows to disseminate plague as
a punishment for sin. Spectres of a black colour dealt
fatal wounds, but those dealt by white spectres were not
fatal. We shall presently find this same fancy figuring in
the literature and art of mediaeval Italy. It is not without
interest to have traced the conception spreading, like the
plague itself, from an endemic focus in the East, first to
Byzantium, and then by slow stages to Italy and the West.</p>

<p>In Byzantium many succumbed to the disease without
any premonitory visions. In these there was a sudden onset
of a mild fever without any grave symptoms, so that the
victim had no apprehension of dying. Then either the same
day, or a day or two after, appeared a bubo (βουβών),
either in the groin or armpit, or behind the ear, or elsewhere.
So far as these symptoms went, all suffered in pretty much
the same way. The Byzantine plague was therefore
characteristically bubonic, and the buboes seem to have been
distributed in the different parts of the body, much as we
find them to-day. In this and in all essential points bubonic
plague still exhibits a striking conformity to the picture
drawn by Procopius some 1,400 years ago. Indeed Procopius
has afforded an admirable outline sketch of oriental
plague, to which the most recent medical science has added
little beyond some elaboration of detail. We can decipher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
in his narrative at least four recognized types—the bubonic,
the pustular, the pneumonic, and the tonsillar—as having
prevailed during this epidemic in Byzantium. Unlike
Thucydides, Procopius rejects the idea of contagion, as
opposed to his own observations. Physicians, nurses, and
those who buried the dead were not, in his experience,
specially affected, in spite of their constant contact with
the sick; and contrariwise, many contracted the disease
without any contact at all. The belief of Procopius in the
pestilence as a special act of God almost necessitated his
being a non-contagionist. He was at a loss whether to
attribute the varied manifestations of the disease to
differences of constitution, or to the will of the Author of
the plague. In one case profound lethargy prevailed, in
another maniacal delirium. The lethargic lay simply
regardless of everything and died of starvation, unless food
was pressed on them. The delirious in their terror tried
to flee: they struggled with their attendants in the attempt
to throw themselves out of windows, or to drown themselves.
Their desire was not to assuage their thirst, for often they
threw themselves into the sea. This is evidently a criticism
of the suggestion of Thucydides that it was thirst that
drove the victims to throw themselves into cisterns.</p>

<p>Procopius says that the physicians conceived that the
source of the disease lay in the buboes. This was a not
unnatural inference from the fact that, in cases of simple
suppuration of the bubo, the sufferer usually recovered, as
though some virulent humour had escaped by this channel.
For the same reason in later years incision was performed,
and suppuration encouraged, whenever practicable. When,
however, the physicians opened the buboes in the hope of
discovering the cause, they found nothing but a horrible
growth, like a carbuncle (ἄνθραξ). The Byzantine physicians
evidently regarded the disease as a morbid process within
the confines of recognized pathology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>There was a pustular type of the disease, and those who
got a crop of black pustules all over the body, as large
as a lentil, died at once. Procopius in his φλυκταίναις
μελαίναις, ὅσον φακοῦ μέγεθος, ἐξήνθει τὸ σῶμα echoes
the language of Thucydides, φλυκταίναις μικραῖς καὶ
ἕλκεσιν ἐξηνθηκός: and it is noteworthy that ulcers were
no feature of the Byzantine plague.</p>

<p>Many dropped dead from spontaneous vomiting of blood,
probably from the lungs, as is not infrequent in the pneumonic
form of plague.</p>

<p>Some escaped with a defect in the speech, so that as long
as they lived they stammered or stuttered, and were
unintelligible. This may well have been a sequel of the
tonsillar type.</p>

<p>The plague lasted in epidemic virulence in Byzantium for
four months in all, and was at its height for three. This
again, speaking broadly, has been a feature of most European
and Levantine outbreaks. At the worst the daily mortality
reached the appalling total of ten thousand.</p>

<p>Procopius dwells at length on the accumulation of dead
bodies in the streets and the neglect of funeral rites. At
first each man buried the dead members of his own household,
sometimes throwing them into graves prepared for others;
but soon buriers failed, and then corpses began to litter the
streets. These Justinian commissioned his agent Theodorus
to bury. When all the existing burial-grounds were filled,
huge burial-pits were dug wherever they could find space all
round the city. Finally, when the digging of graves could
no longer keep pace with the deaths, they mounted the
towers of the city walls in Sycae, the port of Byzantium,
and removing the roofs threw in the bodies promiscuously:
when these were filled, the roofs were replaced. But when
the wind set from that quarter, the awful stench proved
most distressing to the citizens. Many corpses were simply
cast out on the shore, where they were piled in barges and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
turned adrift out to sea. We shall see these various conditions
strikingly reproduced during the plague of Marseilles in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1721. John of Ephesus states that the ambulance
arrangements made by Justinian for the burial of the dead
met all the requirements, but it is impossible to accept his
statement in face of the precise and detailed account of
Procopius.</p>

<p>The horrors of the plague, according to Procopius, turned
men from dissoluteness to piety, for fear that their own death
was imminent. If, however, they fell sick and recovered,
they became even more dissolute than before, in the belief
that they were now safe for the future. According to Thucydides,
the Athenian Greeks became reckless from the first
and gave themselves over to pleasure, seeing that the
disease smote virtuous and vicious alike. Perhaps, however,
the difference lay more in the mental attitude of the observer
than in the actual demeanour of those observed.</p>

<p>All work came to a standstill in Byzantium, so that
famine supervened in the city, where usually everything
was in profusion. Justinian himself became infected and
suffered from an attack, in which a bubo appeared.</p>

<p>Such in brief is the account that Procopius gives of the
plague of Byzantium, as he saw it with his own eyes. Unquestionably
he had before him the description of the plague
of Athens, for now and again he slips into an identical
turn of language. But to speak of him as a flagrant plagiarist
of Thucydides is sheer absurdity. Rather he gives the
impression of maintaining a critical attitude towards
Thucydides, and of emphasizing the points of dissent. Procopius
has no doubt that he is describing the same disease
as Thucydides, and is impressed by the clinical differences
he has observed. The tone of Thucydides is subjective: he
attempts a general description, but cannot keep in the background
the symptoms of his own case. The tone of Procopius
is wholly objective: he writes as an intensely interested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
onlooker, retailing his own observations, supplemented by
the statements of those who have had the disease and
recovered. The apparent resemblance of the two accounts
is really no more than surface deep.</p>

<p>An account of an offset of this pandemic at Antioch
survives from the pen of the historian Evagrius,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> who
was born in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 536 and spent the greater part of his life
at Antioch. Apparently he knew nothing of the records
of Procopius or Agathias, for he says that the history of
this pestilence had not been written previously. He knew
the narrative of the plague of Athens, for he says that this
plague was ‘in some respects much like that which Thucydides
described, in others quite unlike’: it cannot be said
to have influenced either the form or the substance of his
description. He says that it first reached Antioch in 540 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>,
whereas it did not appear at Byzantium till the spring
of 542 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>, and that the pandemic lasted altogether fifty-two
years, exceeding ‘all the diseases that had ever been
before Philostratus wondered at the plague, which was in
his time, because it continued fifteen years’. This is presumed
to have been the Antonine pestilence, for Philostratus
was born in Lemnos about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 170, but spent most of his
life in Rome and died there in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 245. Evagrius had the
fullest opportunities of observing the plague at close quarters,
for as a boy at school he himself suffered from an inguinal
bubo, and in later years he lost his wife and several children
of plague. He was but three years old when it first reached
Antioch, so that his description must represent the disease
after it had been rife for many years. Evagrius traces its
origin further back than does Procopius, placing it in
Ethiopia, so that it may actually have originated in an
endemic area in Central Africa. Spreading over the whole
world, it attacked cities quite irrespective of season, summer
and winter alike. Evagrius has no doubt whatever of the
contagiousness of the distemper. Those, he says, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
escaped one year were attacked the next, and those who
fled to places free from disease were the first to succumb,
as they carried the contagion with them. Infection seemed
to be taken in various ways—by sharing beds, by actual
contact, by visiting infected houses, or even by casual
meeting in the market-place. Some, however, escaped in
spite of running every risk of infection.</p>

<p>The description that Evagrius gives of the symptoms of
the disease, though brief, is wonderfully comprehensive.
It shows that he was cognizant of the tonsillar, the bubonic,
and the carbuncular or pustular types at least, and the
rapidity of a fatal issue in a proportion of the cases suggests
that pneumonic and septicaemic forms were also rife. ‘The
disease’, he writes, ‘was compound and mixt with many other
maladies. It took some men first in the head, made their
eyes as red as blood and puffed up their cheeks: afterwards
it fell at their throat, and whomsoever it took it dispatched
him out of the way. It began with some with a fire and
voiding of all that was within them, in others with swellings
about the secret parts of the body, and there arose burning
fires, so that they died thereof within two or three days of
the furthest in such sort and of so perfect a remembrance as
if they had not been sick at all; others died mad, and
carbuncles that arose out of the flesh killed many.’</p>

<p>Agathias<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> (b. <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 536) describes a recrudescence of this
pandemic in Byzantium in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 558. He carried on the
history of Procopius from its termination to <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 558. He
says that the disease had never really disappeared since the
first outbreak in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 542, when it burst out furiously a
second time in the spring of this year. Many persons fell
as though stricken with apoplexy: those who held out
longest died on the fifth day. Buboes and continuous
fever were the outstanding features, as in the previous
visitation. ‘People of all ages perished indiscriminately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
but especially the young and vigorous and those in the
flower of youth: and of them the males, for the females
were not so much affected. With an epidemic recurrence
such as this, the chief incidence would necessarily be on the
young, who had neither resisted, nor acquired immunity
from, a previous attack. The character of their occupation
or of their habits of life would doubtless explain the special
liability of the males to infection.</p>

<p>Gregory of Tours<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 540-94) testifies to the widespread
character of the plague in France. In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 549 he says that
it depopulated the province of Arles, and afterwards devastated
Narbonne. Here Felix, bishop of Nantes,<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> succumbed
to the sloughing of his legs caused by the application of
cantharides plasters to a crop of pustules.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 566, before the plague invaded the Auvergne,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
a succession of portents terrified the district. Three or four
great brilliant lights made their appearance around the sun,
which nevertheless underwent almost complete eclipse in
October, looking dark and discoloured and like a bag.
The heaven also seemed to be on fire, and many strange
signs were seen. Then in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 567 the epidemic raged
throughout the district, causing an immense mortality.
Lyons, Bourges, Chalons, and Dijon also lost a large part
of their population. Coffins for the dead soon failed, and
as many as ten bodies would be placed in the same grave.
One Sunday no less than three hundred corpses were counted
in the church of St. Peter at Clermont. Death seized the
victims with dramatic suddenness. ‘There grew in the
groin or armpit a lesion in the shape of a serpent, the effect
of which was such that men yielded up their souls on the
second or third day, and its violence completely took away
their senses.’</p>

<p>In this epidemic buboes were evidently most frequently
found in the groins, for Gregory repeatedly speaks of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
disease as <i>lues inguinaria</i> or <i>morbus inguinalis</i> and the
like.</p>

<p>Plague broke out at Marseilles<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 587, brought there
by a merchant ship from Spain, which concealed its contact
with a plague-stricken port. Several people made purchases
from it, and in consequence eight inhabitants of one house
were fatally infected. As in the epidemic of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1720,
the disease did not spread immediately to the whole town.
Bishop Theodore and a few of his suite shut themselves
up in the church of St. Victor, and there, amid the general
desolation, implored the mercy of God with prayer and
vigil till the epidemic was at an end. On the return of the
fugitive populace a belated outbreak exacted its appointed
tribute.</p>

<p>Around Avignon<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> celestial portents foretold the plague
that broke out in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 590. The earth was illuminated
at night by a light as bright as the midday. Balls of fire
were seen tracking the sky during the night. A violent
earthquake was felt at dawn in mid-June. The sun suffered
almost complete eclipse in mid-August. Abundant autumn
thunderstorms and rain raised the rivers in flood.</p>

<p>Meantime Italy, too, had been in like case. Paul the
Deacon<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 720-90) briefly refers to a plague that had
devastated Liguria in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 565. He says that the plague was
presaged by the sudden appearance of marks on houses,
doors, utensils, and clothing, and the more they tried to
efface them the more conspicuous they became. Eusebius<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
in like manner told of moulds on the walls of houses in a
previous pestilence, and in Leviticus<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> we read of greenish
and reddish marks on houses infected with leprosy. Towards
the end of the year buboes began to attack the people,
followed by a fever that killed in three days. The inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
fled, leaving property and cattle and crops, and desolation
reigned supreme.</p>

<p>But it was on the head of hapless Rome that the full fury
of the expiring storm was destined to spend its virulence.
Both Gregory of Tours<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> and Paul the Deacon have left
a record of the havoc. Gregory says that he obtained his
information from his own deacon, who happened to be in
Rome at the time. Paul the Deacon<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> seems to borrow his
material from Gregory of Tours. An inundation of the Tiber
in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 589 resulted in the destruction of many old buildings
on its banks and in the flooding of the granaries of the
church, so that immense stores of grain were spoilt. The
river yielded up a multitude of serpents, and a dragon of
extraordinary size was seen to float through the city on its
passage to the sea. Probably these were eels from the
muddy bed of the Tiber, metamorphosed after the manner
of Ovid into serpents: the dragon no one seems to have
seen at close quarters. The inundation was followed in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 590 by a severe outburst of bubonic plague (<i>pestilentia,
quam inguinariam vocant</i>).</p>

<p>Portents were not confined to Rome. According to
Evagrius,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> a great earthquake in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 589 laid Antioch in
ruins, destroying the sanctuary of the Mother of God,
and taking sixty thousand lives. In Upper Italy also
there were extensive inundations due to overflowing of the
mountain streams in Venetia, Liguria, and the sub-Alpine
plains.</p>

<p>It is instructive to contrast the records of these chroniclers
of the Church of the West with those of Procopius and
Evagrius, and still more so with that of the pagan historian
Thucydides. So intent are they on the mental and moral
features of the distemper, that they say almost nothing of
its physical features. They dilate at length on the visions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
and hallucinations that haunted the distracted fancy of the
sufferers, which Thucydides disregards, though such must
have accompanied the wild delirium he describes. Demons
stalking the streets, ineffaceable marks and moulds on
houses, voices from the grave, and celestial portents were the
creations of the delirious fancy, and are faithfully reproduced
in the pages of the Christian writers. One is sensible of
something of the spirit in which Fra Angelico portrayed
the joys of heaven and the torments of hell, when pestilence
lay heavy on mediaeval Italy. The mortality in Rome was
appalling. Death was rampant everywhere. At first the
dead bodies were gathered up and flung in loads into great
gaping graves, but after a while none were left even to bury
the dead, and putrid corpses littered the streets. All business
was at a standstill, and such as survived were huddled,
panic-stricken like sheep, in the insecure sanctuary of the
churches. To add to the general consternation, Pope
Pelagius perished on February 8, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 590. The choice
of a successor lay with the clergy and people of Rome,
subject to confirmation by the Emperor. With one accord
they haled Abbot Gregory from the seclusion of his monastery
to the pontifical chair in anticipation of the Imperial
assent. Gregory of Tours, Paul the Deacon, and John the
Deacon all tell of Gregory’s unwillingness to obey the summons,
and of his attempt to intercept the letter of election
on its way to the Emperor in Constantinople. But meantime,
as the plague showed no sign of abating, Gregory
determined to try to appease the wrath of God by a special
act of contrition. Ascending the pulpit of St. John Lateran,
he preached a memorable sermon, which has been preserved
by the hand of Gregory of Tours. He implored them to
make their sufferings an instrument for their conversion,
and a means by which to soften the hardness of their hearts.
He besought them, as Cyprian had done before, as Borromeo
and Belsunce were to do hereafter, not to let the suddenness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
with which death seized them, sweeping away numbers at
a time, and giving no opportunity for tears of penitence,
find them unprepared to meet their God. Let them call their
sins to mind and purge them away with weeping, for God
wills not the death of a sinner, but rather that he may turn
from his wickedness and live. Let no man despair because
of the multitude of his offences. Did not God forgive the
people of Nineveh of old, when they did penance for three
days, and did He not give the reward of everlasting life to
the dying thief? Let them therefore turn with him to God
with importunity of prayer, or ever the sword of punishment
descend. Does He not say by the mouth of the Psalmist:
call upon Me in the time of trouble: so will I hear thee and
thou shalt praise Me. Let them all come with contrite hearts
and mended moods at early dawn on the fourth day from
then to the celebration of a sevenfold litany, and with
lamentation in their souls, so that the stern Judge may remit
the sentence of damnation He has purposed to pass upon
them. Let the clergy then start from the church of the
martyr-saints Cosmo and Damian, along with the priests
of the sixth region. All the abbots with their monks from
the church of the martyrs Gervase and Protasius, along with
the priests of the fourth region. All the abbesses with their
flocks from the church of the martyr-saints Marcellinus and
Peter, along with the priests of the first region. All the
children from the church of the martyr-saints John and
Paul, along with the priests of the second region. All the
laity from the church of the protomartyr-saint Stephen,
along with the priests of the seventh region. All the widowed
women from the church of St. Euphemia, along with the
priests of the fifth region. And the married women from the
church of the martyr-saint Clement, along with the priests
of the third region. Let them all go forth from these several
churches with prayer and lamentation, to meet at the
basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary the Mother of Christ,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
there with long and earnest supplication to implore pardon
for their sins.</p>

<p>So Gregory distributed the remnant that the plague had
spared according to the seven ecclesiastical regions of Rome,
bidding his clergy spend the three days’ interval in ceaseless
psalms and prayers for mercy. Then on the fourth day, the
festival of St. Mark, in the pale light of the early April
morning, the great procession set out. With solemn chant of
doleful <i>Miserere</i>, these seven trains of human suffering
wended their slow way sadly amid the ruined monuments
of ancient Rome. No other sound broke the stillness, but
the faint rustle of sweeping garments and the silent shuffle
of sick men’s feet. Now and again one fell stricken and lay
as he fell, for Death was moving hither and thither among
the moving ranks.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> No less than eighty breathed out their
lives before the church of the Mother of God was reached.
There again Gregory fervently exhorted the people to repentance,
so that the plague might cease.</p>

<p>A legend has it that as Gregory, heading his train of penitents,
reached the Aelian Bridge, there, right before him,
on the summit of Hadrian’s mole, a heavenly vision met his
eyes. There stood the Archangel Michael, restoring a flaming
sword to its sheath, in token that the plague was stayed.
It is to this legend that the mausoleum owes the name of
Castel S. Angelo, that it has borne since the tenth century
at least. A bronze figure of the Archangel sheathing his
sword still hovers on the summit, fifth of a series that have
stood there at different times.</p>

<p>The legend of the angel is not mentioned by either of
Gregory’s biographers, the deacons Paul and John, or by
Bede or Gregory of Tours. Though of earlier origin than
the tenth century, the first written records of it are in
a German sermon of the twelfth or thirteenth century and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
in the <i>Legenda Aurea</i> of the end of the thirteenth century
Caxton has rendered it thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘And because the mortality ceased not, he ordained
a procession, in which he did do bear an image of our Lady,
which, as is said, St. Luke the Evangelist made, which was
a good painter, he had carved it and painted it after the
likeness of the glorious Virgin Mary. And anon the mortality
ceased, and the air became pure and clear, and about the
image was heard a voice of angels that sung this Anthem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Regina Coeli laetare! Alleluia.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quia quem meruisti portare: Alleluia.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Resurrexit sicut dixit: Alleluia.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and St. Gregory put thereto</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ora pro nobis, deum rogamus: Alleluia.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the same time St. Gregory saw an angel upon a castle,
which made clean a sword all bloody, and put it into the
sheath, and thereby St. Gregory understood that the
pestilence of this mortality was passed, and after that it was
called the Castle Angel.’</p>

</div>

<p>In memory of this legend the great processions from
S. Marco, until the prohibition of processions in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1870,
used to strike up the antiphon ‘Regina Coeli’, as soon as
they came to the bridge of Hadrian.</p>

<p>For the true source of this legend there is no need to look
beyond the vision of the angel at the threshing-floor of
Araunah: ‘And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel
of the Lord stand between the earth and the heaven, having
a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.’
In the Capitoline Museum is an altar dedicated to Isis by
some traveller on his safe return, and bearing the customary
imprint of two feet. The devout believed these to be the
footprints of the angel that appeared to Gregory, and the
altar once stood in the church of Ara Coeli.</p>

<p>It is certain that at least as early as this time pictures
were carried in public procession. Theophylactus<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
described two occasions on which a sacred effigy of Christ,
believed not to have been made by human hands, was carried
into battle for the sake of inspiring valour and discipline
into the soldiery (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 586 and 588). Among the many
gems in which Bede’s <i>Ecclesiastical History</i><a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> abounds is
that picture of the arrival of Augustine and his companions
in Thanet ‘bearing a silver cross for their banner, and the
image of our Lord and Saviour painted on a board’ (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>
597). The sixteenth-century chronicler Baronius says, that
the picture which Gregory carried in this plague procession
of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 590 was that of the Madonna, now preserved in the
church of S. Maria Maggiore on the Esquiline, and still
believed to protect Rome from plague and pestilence. Rome
has no fewer than four pictures of the Madonna attributed
like this one to the hand of Luke the Physician, and all of
them reputed to have wonder-working powers. Expert
opinion, alas! pronounces the oldest of them a fifteenth-century
production.</p>

<p>Gregory’s procession has afforded a favourite theme for
art. It is the subject of one of the frescoes in the Lady
Chapel of Winchester Cathedral executed under the direction
of Prior Silkstede at the beginning of the sixteenth century.
The scene is also shown in a picture in the Chiesa del San
Pietro at Perugia, in a modern picture by the Austrian
painter Hiremy Hirsch, and in several others elsewhere.
The miniature figured on the opposite page is one of two from
a beautiful Livre d’Heures, of the early fifteenth century, and
once the property of the Duc de Berry. It is now in the
Musée Condé of the Château de Chantilly.</p>

<p>An Italian tradition refers the custom of saying ‘Bless you’,
when a person sneezes, to the time of the pestilence of
Gregory, in which all those that sneezed were said to have
died. Boersch, quoting from the local chronicles of Kleinlauel
and of Oseas Schadaeus, would trace its origin to the plague<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
at Strasbourg in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 591.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> ‘And when any one sneezed,
he gave up the ghost forthwith. Hence the saying “God
help you”. And when any one yawned, he died. Hence
it comes that when any one yawns, one makes the sign of
the cross before the mouth.’ Probably the association is
even older than this, for Thucydides speaks of sneezing in
the plague of Athens. Sneezing and yawning were prominent
features of the Sweating Sickness.</p>

</div>

<p>In the summer of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 680 Rome was again gripped in
the toils of an appalling plague that had spread over the
greater part of Italy. Paul the Deacon<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> says that eclipses
of both sun and moon in May were followed by pestilence in
the months of July, August, and September. Describing its
ravages at Ticinum (Pavia) Paul says that ‘the number of the
dead was so great that parents were often carried to burial
on the same biers as their children, and brothers along with
sisters.... And then many saw with their own eyes a good
and a bad angel passing through the city by night. And
whenever at the bidding of the good angel, the bad one,
who seemed to carry a lance in his hand, struck so many
times with his lance on the door of each house, as many of
that household would die on the following day. Then it was
revealed to some one that the plague would not cease until
an altar was set up to Sebastian, saint and martyr, at the
church of S. Pietro in Vincoli. This was done, and as soon
as the altar was set up, the relics of the martyr-saint
Sebastian were brought from Rome, and forthwith the
plague ceased.’</p>

<p>Paul the Deacon, beyond all doubt, was referring to the
church of S. Pietro in Vincoli at Pavia, but the Romans of
later date claimed the legend for their own church of the
same name, in which it has been embodied in a fresco of
the fifteenth century, ascribed to Pollajuolo (1429-98). In
the background, at the summit of a flight of stairs, presumably
suggested by those of Ara Coeli, a citizen is telling
to Pope Agatho, who is seated among his cardinals, his
dream that the pestilence will not cease till the body of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
S. Sebastian is brought into the city. On the right the good
angel indicates the condemned houses to the bad angel in
the guise of the Evil One, who strikes on the door with his
lance. On the left a procession, carrying a banner on which
the Madonna is depicted with robe spread out in protecting
attitude, is bringing in the relics. The foreground is strewn
with corpses of the dead. In the sky, bow in hand, hovers
the angel that spreads the pestilence. To the left is a group
of the Almighty and angels, now almost obliterated.</p>

<p>It is not generally recognized that the well-known picture
‘La Peste à Rome’, by Delaunay (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1828-91), now in the
Musée du Luxembourg at Paris, was directly inspired by
this fresco. The scene is laid in a street of Rome, which is
strewn with bodies of dead and dying, among which the good
and evil angels are busy at their task. The figure of a youth
huddled up in a brown shawl on a doorstep is a living picture
of misery. In the background a procession bearing a cross is
descending a flight of stairs, and a fire to purify the atmosphere
is burning in the open street. An effigy of Aesculapius
and a colossal equestrian statue of Constantine are introduced
in the manner of the Renaissance. The chief merit
of the picture lies in the excellence of its draughtsmanship.</p>

<p>In this same church at Rome is a mosaic effigy of Sebastian,
believed to have been executed in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 683. In spite,
however, of the name of Sebastian, that it carries in gold
mosaic letters, it is difficult to believe that it is anything but
a figure of St. Peter, transformed perhaps in the presence of
this epidemic to that of Sebastian. It represents faithfully
the traditional lineaments of the apostle, an old man with
white hair and beard, dressed in the true Byzantine style.
Kugler considers that the careful shadowing of the drapery,
executed with more than usual pains, indicates that the
effigy was intended to be exposed to the close gaze of the
pious. The figure on its blue mosaic background is stiff and
inanimate, even beyond other similar archaic effigies. Beside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
it, on a marble tablet, is an inscription in Latin, reproducing
almost to a word the story told by Paul the Deacon. Tradition
has it that Pope Agatho (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 678-82) on this occasion
caused the bones of the saint to be collected in the cemetery
of Calixtus, and brought to the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli,
there to be enshrined beneath an altar. In the ninth century
the body seems to have been removed for safety to the
Vatican, and again transferred to the church of S. Sebastiano,
where it now is, by Honorius III in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1216. This church,
however, was completely rebuilt in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1611.</p>

<p>From the time of this pestilence in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 680, Sebastian was
universally recognized as the patron saint of pestilence.
Gradually he comes to be identified more particularly with
true plague, but never in the same exclusive fashion as his
brother saint, St. Roch. His comprehensive patronage of
pestilence indicates not only how rife were other epidemic
diseases besides true plague, but how little they were
differentiated in the public mind.</p>

<p>The story of the life of Sebastian<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> is well authenticated
in its main incidents. Born in the middle of the third century
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>, he was a native of Narbonne in Gaul. His noble birth
secured for him early in life the command of a company of
Praetorian Guards, so that he was constantly about the
person of the Emperor. Though secretly a Christian and
using his position to secure the conversion of others to
Christianity, he remained intensely loyal to the temporal
interest of the Emperor. Among his friends were two young
soldiers, Marcus and Marcellinus, like him of noble birth.
They were convicted of embracing Christianity, and after
enduring torture bravely were led out to die. On the way
their aged parents, their wives and children, and their
friends, implored them to relent, and they were about to
recant, when Sebastian rushed forward and exhorted them
not to renounce their Redeemer. So inspiring was his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
appeal, that the whole assembly, guards, judges, and all,
were converted and baptized, and for a while Marcus and
Marcellinus were saved. This scene is depicted in a spirited
canvas by Veronese in the plague church of S. Sebastiano at
Venice. Their respite was but short, for in a few months
they were put to death with many others of the Christian
community, and Sebastian himself was condemned to die.
The Emperor Diocletian (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 284-305), by reason of his
personal attachment, sent for him and exhorted him to
abjure his heresy, but Sebastian meekly and courageously
refused. Diocletian then ordered that he should be bound
to a stake and shot to death with arrows, and that an
inscription should be placed on the stake for all to see,
saying that he was put to death only for being a Christian.
A vast number of pictures, beside the masterpiece of Sodoma,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
depict this scene. Pierced with arrows, Sebastian was left
for dead, but at midnight Irene, the widow of one of his
martyred friends, came to take away his body for burial,
but found him still alive, the arrows having pierced no vital
part. She and her attendants carried him to her house and
tended him, till he was completely healed. After this they
urged him to leave Rome, but Sebastian went boldly to the
palace gate, and as the Emperor passed out, pleaded for
those Christians who were condemned to suffer for their
faith, and reproached Diocletian for his cruelty. The
Emperor in fierce anger ordered his guards to seize Sebastian
and carry him to the circus, there to beat him to death with
clubs. To conceal his dead body from his friends it was
thrown into the Cloaca Maxima, but a Christian woman,
Lucina, received tidings in a vision of where the body lay,
and recovering it had it secretly buried in the catacombs.
The church of S. Sebastiano at Rome is now built over these
catacombs.</p>

<p class="caption">SEBASTIAN AS PROTECTOR AGAINST PESTILENCE</p>

<p class="caption">By Benozzo Gozzoli. Photograph by Brogi, Florence</p>

<p class="caption-r">(Face <a href="#Page_99">Page 99</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>Though Sebastian was martyred in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 288, it was not till<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
the plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 683 that his cult as a protector from
pestilence was firmly established.</p>

<p>The association of Sebastian with pestilence was in the
first instance purely fortuitous. Devout men in seasons of
pestilence were wont to acclaim their own peculiar patron
saint a very present help in time of trouble: an altar,
a church, a votive picture, a procession, these, now one, now
another, were the price of the promised dispensation. But
that Sebastian came to be the patron saint of plague and
pestilence was due to the association of arrows with his
effigy and with the story of his attempted martyrdom.
From remote antiquity we have seen that arrows have been
emblematic of plague. It was Apollo among the Greeks
that scattered pestilence with his bow, and who was invoked
also by sacrifice and hymns of praise to avert it. In Christian
hagiology and Christian art Sebastian is the counterpart
of the pagan Apollo. Whatever the variations of detail,
Sebastian is practically always represented, either transfixed
with arrows or carrying an arrow in his hand. Having
regard to his story, it is a mistake to show the arrows piercing
a vital part, such as the heart, the brain, or even the neck,
as is often done. And for artistic effect it is well that they
should not be so numerous as to suggest a well-filled pin-cushion:
albeit the <i>Golden Legend</i> has it that ‘the archers
shot at him till he was as full of arrows as an urchin is full of
pricks’.</p>

<p>Such is the effect of an interesting fresco by Benozzo
Gozzoli (<i>c.</i> <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1420-97) in the Chiesa della Collegiata at
San Gimignano, dedicated to Sebastian in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1465 in
a time of plague. At the head of the picture, Christ, with
the marks of wounds in His hands, communes with the
Virgin and a group of saints. Sebastian is standing on
a pedestal, his whole body studded with arrows, while
archers on either side of him are rapidly increasing the
number. This Collegiata fresco has been closely followed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
in an Italian <i>Pestblätter</i>, reproduced in the Heitz-Schreiber
portfolio of <i>Pestblätter</i> (q. v.).</p>

<p>Another votive fresco in the church of S. Agostino at San
Gimignano, also by Benozzo Gozzoli, commemorating the
disastrous plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1464, shows Sebastian turning aside
with his cloak the broken arrows of pestilence. In the
uppermost part of the fresco the Almighty is launching forth
His shafts, and attendant angels are aiding in the task.
Between them and Sebastian Christ and the Virgin kneel in
an attitude of prayer. Sebastian stands in the centre of the
foreground on a low stone pedestal, on which are inscribed
the words, ‘Sancte Sebastiane, Intercede Pro Devoto Populo
Tuo.’ His body is fully draped, and the broken arrows lie
behind him, removed by the hands of angels, two of whom
hold a crown of martyrdom above his head.</p>

<p>These older representations of Sebastian by Benozzo
Gozzoli, and others by Albrecht Dürer and the early German
school, showing Sebastian as an elderly bearded man, offer
but little attractiveness. By far the most beautiful pictures
are those of Perugino, Sodoma, and Francia, who use his
nude and youthful figure, as the Greeks used Apollo, as
a model for the exhibition of elegance of form and accuracy
of anatomical design. As one of the few nude forms permitted
to Christian art, it is readily understood why Sebastian
figures in such a multitude of pictures. The finest example
of this type is the peerless masterpiece of Sodoma (1477-1549),
now in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, one of the most
beautiful creations of Renaissance art. It was formerly
a banner, painted in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1528 for the Sienese Compagnia
di San Sebastiano in Camollia, and was carried in procession
when Siena was afflicted with pestilence. It was kept in
the church of the Confraternity at Siena, until it was removed
to Florence in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1786. The undraped body of the saint is
modelled on the lines of the youthful Apollo. He is bound
to a tree in the foreground of a wild Italian landscape.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
His neck, side, and one thigh are transfixed with arrows.
The upturned face wears an expression of ecstasy, in spite
of suffering, as an angel descends to place the crown of
martyrdom on his brow. Symonds has said of this picture:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Gifted with an exquisite feeling for the beauty of the
human body, Sodoma excelled himself when he was contented
with a single figure. His St. Sebastian, notwithstanding
its wan and faded colouring, is still the very best that has
been painted. Suffering, refined and spiritual, without
contortion or spasm, could not be presented with more pathos
in a form of more surpassing loveliness. This is a truly
demonic picture in the fascination it exercises and the
memory it leaves upon the mind. Part of its unanalysable
charm may be due to the bold thought of combining the
beauty of a Greek Hylas with the Christian sentiment of
martyrdom. Only the Renaissance could have produced
a hybrid so successful, because so deeply felt.’</p>

</div>

<p>On the reverse of the banner is the Madonna with the
Child in her arms, enthroned on clouds, above a kneeling
group of SS. Roch and Sigismund and members of the
Compagnia di S. Sebastiano, wearing their characteristic
garments. The work is much inferior to that of the face of
the banner, and is said to be in part the work of Beccafumi
(1486-1551).</p>

<p>Another superb, but little known picture, by Perugino
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1446-1524) in the Musée at Grenoble, shows the same
type of nude figure of Sebastian bound to a tree. Face and
figure alike are the very embodiment of youthfulness and
grace, verging almost on effeminacy. In this picture
S. Apolline stands beside Sebastian.</p>

<p>Exceptionally, and more particularly in the older pictures,
the youthful Sebastian is depicted clothed in the costume
of the period, with or without an arrow in his hand. In the
Brera at Milan is a folding altar-piece of five panels by
Nicolò da Foligno (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1430-92), in which he is represented
as a youth in kilted tunic and hose. He is similarly clad
in another picture in the Vatican, ‘The Coronation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
Virgin and Saints,’ also by Nicolò da Foligno, and in a few
others as well.</p>

<p>Sebastian is very frequently represented in plague pictures
along with other saints: his most frequent companion by
far is St. Roch. In the sacristy of S. Maria della Salute at
Venice, itself a plague church, is Titian’s well-known picture
commemorating the great plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1512, in which
St. Sebastian, St. Roch, and the physician-saints Cosmo
and Damian stand before the throne of St. Mark, across
whose majestic figure the shadow of a cloud has fallen. These
groups of saints are not infrequently represented mediating
with the Madonna.</p>

<p>Travelling through Italy from town to town one becomes
aware that the land of pestilence has been roughly partitioned
into separate dominions under the tutelage of varying
presiding saints. In Milan it is Carlo Borromeo: in Venice,
S. Rocco: in Rome, the Madonna: in Central Italy, in
Siena, and in Florence, S. Sebastiano. In Florence he was
the patron saint of the Compagnia della Misericordia, the
institution that has for seven centuries been so closely
interwoven with the daily life of the city, and has left no
small mark on the products of Florentine art.</p>

<p>Christian sculpture has also seized the opportunity of the
nude figure for a model. Well-known statues are those by
Matteo Civitali (<i>c.</i> 1470) at Lucca, and by Puget (1622-94)
in the church of Carignano at Genoa. A colossal recumbent
figure of the saint by Bernini (1598-1680) lies beneath the
high altar of the church of S. Sebastian on the Via Appia
at Rome.</p>

<p>In Switzerland especially, but also in southern Germany
and south-eastern France, wooden statues of Sebastian are
commonly met with, mostly belonging to the three centuries
following the Black Death. Several may be seen in the
Historical Museum at Basle, more or less archaic in character,
and a very fine example in the Cluny Museum at Paris. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
same museum also possesses a pair of quaint coloured high
reliefs in wood of St. Sebastian and St. Roch respectively.
These wooden effigies are naturally most common in districts
where wood-carving has been extensively pursued.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the cult of Sebastian was
widespread from the first, or that the record of its growth
is continuous and unbroken from its inauguration in this
Roman plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 683. Circumstance chanced to be
arrayed against its continuity. The seventh century was
not a notable period of plague in Europe, and that was now
the dominating epidemic. There was famine and pestilence
in Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> but its nature is not known, and the kings of
Erin faced their Irish question in the spirit of Cromwell. In
a season of famine they summoned the leading clergy and
laity to a council to consider the situation. No one, in the
circumstances, will dispute the propriety of their injunction
to clergy and laity to observe a fast. But the further
injunction that they should employ their hours of abstinence
in praying that some sickness might carry off the surplus
of the lower orders, as the excess of population was the cause
of the famine, is more debatable. (‘Petebant ut nimia
multitudo vulgi per infirmitatem aliquam tolleretur, quia
numerositas populi erat occasio famis.’) At the instance of
St. Gerald, who contended that the Almighty could relieve
the situation more suitably and quite as easily by multiplying
the fruits of the earth, it was proposed to recommend this
course to His adoption, at any rate as a preliminary measure.
But clergy and laity, headed by the holy St. Fechin, were
in no mood for such half-hearted measures as promised no
finality, and St. Gerald’s suggestion was set aside. Pestilence
followed in due course, and the Divine working was made
manifest in that it claimed St. Fechin and the two kings of
Erin among its innumerable victims.</p>

<p>In spite of the retrocession of plague from Europe after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the seventh century, Syria,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> the Euphrates valley, and Irak
were still devastated at frequent intervals by recurring
epidemics. From this persistent source it spread as far as
Constantinople in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 697 and 794, in the latter case almost
completely depopulating Constantinople according to Nicephoras
Byzantinus. Constantinople was in such intimate
relation, commercial and political, with Syria and Central
Asia that transference of plague was wellnigh inevitable.
After this there was a long lull in Europe, and to a less extent
in Syria, until the eleventh century. It is often confidently
stated that the Crusades brought plague back to Europe,
but it must not be forgotten that there was a severe epidemic
of plague on that continent in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1094, before the Crusades
commenced. Doubtless they served to maintain the continuity
of infection. The pestilence that decimated the
army of Louis IX and carried off him and his son was by
no means certainly bubonic plague. The surviving accounts
suggest rather cholera or dysentery. Again, in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1167, the
army of Frederick Barbarossa, while encamped before Rome,
was swept away by a pestilence, that seems to have been
bubonic plague, which penetrated into the city also and
worked great havoc. Thomas à Becket, writing to Pope
Alexander III after the retreat of Frederick, congratulates
him on the Lord having destroyed Sennacherib’s army.
Again, in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1230, a destructive inundation of the Tiber
was followed by plague, that led the Romans to recall the
banished pope, Gregory IX. In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1244 plague was in
Florence, and led to the institution of the Compagnia della
Misericordia. Its foundations were laid in the fines paid by
wool-porters for the use of foul and blasphemous language
at their meeting-house. One of them, the good old Piero di
Luca Borsi, induced them, when the total had reached a large
sum, to spend it in the provision of six litters, one for each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
ward of the city, and to select two of their members weekly
for each litter, to carry sick persons to the hospitals or dead
bodies to the mortuaries.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1294 plague was again widespread and severe in
Europe, and a succession of scattered epidemics, of which the
most severe were those of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1320 and 1333 respectively in
southern France and Spain, led up to the virulent pandemic of
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348 and after, commonly known as the Black Death.</p>

<p>Out of the desolate wilderness of the Black Death arose
the figure of St. Roch,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> patron saint of the plague-stricken
and intercessor against the plague. Born at Montpellier, the
son of noble parents, probably about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1295, he seemed
designed for a life of sanctity by the birthmark of a small
red cross on his breast. So Mahomet before him had borne in
the imprint of a mole between his shoulders the token of his
divine mission. From boyhood he was attracted by the
active virtues of the Redeemer, and aspired to follow that
example rather than to devote himself to the life of the
cloister. The death of his parents, before he was twenty
years old, left him with great riches, which he distributed
forthwith among the poor and hospitals. His lands he left
in the management of his brother, and set out on foot, as
a pilgrim, for Rome. On his way he found plague raging at
Aquapendente. There he gave himself to the service of the
sick in the hospital, and such was his skill and sympathy
that his ministrations were regarded as more than human.
The sick seemed to be healed by his mere prayers, or by the
sign of the Cross as he stood over them, so that when the
plague soon ceased, they in their enthusiasm attributed it to
his intercession. So Roch himself became inspired with the
belief in a divine Providence specially guiding his ministry.
Hearing that plague was devastating the province of
Romagna, he hastened thither and devoted himself to the
sick in the cities of Casena and Rimini. Thence he went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
to Rome, where plague was raging fiercely (<i>c.</i> 1306), and
for three years tended the sick, devoting himself to those
most destitute of help. His constant prayer to God was
that he might be a martyr in his task, but for long he passed
unscathed through daily peril. Visiting city after city,
wherever plague was rife, he succumbed at last to the
infection at Piacenza, while nursing the sick in the hospital.
Along with a burning inward fever, a horrible ulcer broke
out on his left thigh. The pain was so intolerable that he
shrieked aloud. Fearing to disturb the inmates of the
hospital, he crawled into the street, but the officers would
not let him remain there for fear of spreading infection.
With the aid of his pilgrim’s staff he dragged himself to
a solitary spot outside the gates of Piacenza, and there laid
himself down to die. But still a kind Providence watched
over him. His little dog, that had attended him faithfully in
all his pilgrimage, went daily into the city and brought back
a loaf of bread, none knew whence. An angel came, too,
and dressed his sore and tended him, till he was well. Others
say that it was the dog of a countryman, one Gothard, that
brought food to him. On his recovery he turned his steps
back to his native Montpellier, but his sufferings had so
changed him that even his own retainers there did not
recognize him. He was arrested as a spy, and condemned by
the judge, who chanced to be his own uncle, to be thrown
into the public prison. Roch, believing it to be God’s will,
yielded to the punishment without revealing his identity,
and languished in a dungeon for five years. One morning,
when the jailer entered his cell, he found it filled with a bright
supernatural light, but his prisoner dead, and by his side
a writing that revealed his name and the words: ‘All those
that are stricken by the plague, and who pray for aid through
the merits and intercession of St. Roch, the servant of God,
shall be healed.’ His uncle, the judge, gave him an honourable
burial, and the whole city lamented his death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>St. Roch is believed to have died in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1327 in his thirty-second
year. At Montpellier he was venerated from the first,
and this veneration was quickened and extended by the
great pandemic of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348. But it was not till the fifteenth
century that his cult became widespread. This was the
direct consequence of an outbreak of plague at Constance in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1414, during that Council of prelates that condemned
Huss to the stake. They were about to disperse and fly
from danger, when a young German monk told them of the
power of St. Roch. On his advice the Council ordered an
effigy of the Saint to be carried in procession through the
streets with prayers and litanies: and immediately the
plague was stayed. His festival has been celebrated for
centuries on the sixteenth day of August.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1485 the Venetians, who from their trade with the
Levant, were constantly subject to plague, carried off the
body of St. Roch from Montpellier by stealth, and the church
of San Rocco was built to receive it.</p>

<p>Such is the legend of St. Roch. He and Sebastian commonly
figure together in dedicatory plague pictures, as dual
protectors against plague. They seem to represent in art
two attitudes to suffering, St. Roch that of compassion,

<p>Coming into general knowledge about the time of the
revival of art, the legend of St. Roch and his figure were
favourite and familiar subjects in the Christian art of the
West. The whole legend has been frequently used as a theme
for the decoration of churches dedicated to his name: such
a one may be seen in Siena, and another, though less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
complete, in Venice. In the Scuola di S. Rocco his life-story
is set out in a series of twenty carved reliefs on the walnut
panelling of the upper hall.</p>

<p>Sometimes several scenes from his life are blended in
a single picture. In the Brera, at Milan, is a picture of
St. Roch with Madonna and Child, by Ambrogio da Fossano,
called ‘Borgognone’ (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1480-1523). In the background
are scenes from his life, among which his dog is shown
carrying a loaf in its mouth. The picture formerly belonged
to the Company of Charity of Milan.</p>

<p>St. Roch is generally represented as a man in the prime
of life, with a short pointed beard, delicate features, and
a gentle expression of countenance. As a rule he wears
a pilgrim’s dress, with a cockle-shell in his hat and a wallet
at his side. In one hand he holds a long staff, while with the
other he lifts his robe to show the plague sore in his groin
or thigh. Very rarely he is figured as a youth in the dress
of the period, and is then nearly always introduced to
balance a similar Sebastian.</p>

<p>Numerous pictures deal with single episodes in his life—his
tending the plague-sick, his healing by an angel, his life
and death in prison. The best known are perhaps those by
Tintoretto in the church of S. Rocco at Venice. Many show
him praying among the sick, as in the picture by Domenichino
of Bologna (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1584-1641) in the Palazzo Rosso at Genoa.
An angel with a drawn sword hovers over the scene, and
St. Roch holds out one arm, as though entreating the angel
to put up his sword into its sheath. Jacopo Bassano
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1510-92), in a picture in the Brera, represents him
among a number of plague victims, with hand raised in
attitude of benediction.</p>

<p>A picture by the Swiss painter, Niklaus Manuel (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1484-1530),
at Basle, painted in tempera on linen, shows St. Roch
with a little angel tending his wound. It is typical of a large
group of intercessory plague pictures. At the summit of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
picture is the Almighty in glory in the heavens. Beneath
Him is St. Anna with the Virgin Mary and the Child Jesus:
they are placed between the Almighty and the plague-stricken
to indicate that they are the appropriate medium
of intercession. They are flanked on the one side by St. Roch,
and on the other by St. James. St. Anna appears in many
pictures of this period, as Pope Alexander II in 1494 promoted
her worship, by making her feast-day one of the chief
festivals of the Church. At the foot of the picture is a rough
delineation of the city attacked by plague: on the right of
it, a group representing probably the donors of the picture:
on the left, a group of sufferers, two of whom show plague
marks on their limbs. On the woman’s arm is a raised sore:
on the man’s arm black petechial blotches, on his body large
circular spots, and an open red ulcer on the inner side of
his leg.</p>

<p>One of the most famous pictures of St. Roch is the altar-piece
by Rubens, at Alost, near Brussels. The upper part
of the picture shows the interior of a prison illuminated by
a supernatural light. St. Roch kneels looking up into the
face of Christ, in radiant gratitude, as he receives his commission
as patron saint against the plague. An angel holds
a tablet on which is written, ‘Eris in peste patronus,’ in
allusion to the words revealed in his cell at his death.</p>

<p>Statues of St. Roch are hardly so frequently met with as
those of Sebastian: he was a less attractive model for
sculptors. In the Musée of Grenoble is a quaint archaic
wooden figure of St. Roch of the early fifteenth century,
which stood formerly in the chapel of the Château of Bressieux.
It shows him in pilgrim guise, holding aside his
garments to show the bubo in his left groin. It is deeply
incised, according to the surgical practice of the period.</p>

<p>The plague mark of St. Roch is depicted in a variety of
forms. Sometimes it is simply a bubo in the groin, usually
the left, or just below it, to satisfy artistic decency. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
form may be seen in a picture by Crivelli (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1468-93)
of ‘Four Saints’, in the Academy at Venice, and in another
of St. Roch and St. Sebastian, by Alfani, in the Pinacotheca
at Perugia.</p>

<p>Far more commonly the mark is a short longitudinal
incision in the upper part of either thigh, as in Sodoma’s
plague banner (see Plate VIII, p. 100).</p>

<p>Sometimes the incision is in the substance of a bubo. This
may be seen in a portrait of St. Roch over a side altar in the
church of S. Maria dei Servi at Siena.</p>

<p>Not infrequently the incision is slanting or transverse
and displays a complete disregard for the femoral artery.
A notable example is Titian’s ‘St. Mark and Saints’ in the
Salute at Venice (see Plate IX, p. 102).</p>

<p>Sometimes the hose is slit over the incision in the flesh,
as though some bold and busy surgeon had been pressed for
time. This may be seen in Caroto’s picture of ‘Four Saints’
in the church of S. Fermo Maggiore at Verona: also in
a picture by Perugino, ‘Virgin and Saints,’ in the cathedral
at Perugia, and in another of St. Roch in the Palazzo
Borromeo at Milan.</p>

<p>A solitary example of St. Roch with a black pustule on
the inner side of his left thigh, surrounded by a pink zone of
inflammation, may be seen in the Brera. The picture is by
Bernardino Borgognone (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1490-1524).</p>

<p>In some of the <i>Pestblätter</i> a gash in the thigh is shown
as well as a small circle, which would seem to indicate the
circular plague pustule.</p>

<p>There is no need to rewrite the history of the Black Death:
that has been admirably accomplished by Hecker and by
Abbot Gasquet. It is still profitable, however, to investigate
its by-effects in the domains of literature and art, and to
consider its broad morbid features, as a contribution to the
medical history of the time. The Black Death was the first
great pandemic that left in its wake a complete and continuous
succession of literary and historical records, in most
points complementary, in some frankly contradictory, but
for all that none the less instructive.</p>

<p>As to the starting-point of the pandemic there is a diversity
of voices. Russian records place it in India, Greek in
Scythia, English in India and Asiatic Turkey, Arabian in
Tartary and the land of darkness. According to Italian
tradition it originated in Cathay, to the north of China, and
spread in every direction from that focus; northward by
Bokhara and Tartary to the Black Sea; to India and the
towns south of the Caspian, and to Asia Minor; and by
way of Bagdad through Arabia and Egypt to the north of
Africa. The leading contemporary Italian authority is
Gabrielle de Mussi, a notary of Piacenza, who himself saw
its outbreak in Upper Italy. In his ‘Ystoria de morbo seu
mortalitate qui fuit a 1348’, first printed by Henschel in
Haeser’s <i>Archiv für die gesammte Medicin</i>, he describes how
the plague was brought by ship from Caffa; a Genoese settlement
in the Crimea. The Tartar city Tana (Port Azov), that
had been appropriated by Italian merchants, was besieged in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1346 by an army of Tartars and Saracens. The Tartars
expelled them, and followed them to Caffa, whither they
had fled. Plague broke out fiercely among the besieging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
Tartars, who, in the hope of infecting the garrison, threw
their dead bodies into the city by means of engines of war.
The garrison in turn cast them into the sea, but the city
became infected and almost completely depopulated, a few
survivors taking ship and carrying the disease with them
to Italy in the autumn of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1347. Speaking of the infection
of Caffa, de Mussi says ‘the air became tainted and the
wells of water poisoned, and in this way the disease spread
rapidly in the city’. So the old idea of poison still prevails,
but it is a virus derived from infected corpses, and not some
extraneous poison compounded by a maleficent enemy.
The poison was communicable also from man to man, for he
says of the sailors coming from Caffa to Venice and Genoa
that ‘as if accompanied by evil spirits, as soon as they
approached the land, they were death to those with whom
they mingled’.</p>

<p>These ships seem to have infected Constantinople <i>en route</i>,
and an account of its ravages there survives from the pen
of the Emperor Cantacuzenus.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It is a mistake to regard
his record as worthless material, because of its plagiarism
of much of the language of Thucydides. In what is not
appropriated from this source he gives a valuable clinical
description of the disease. He notes the early low delirium,
and distinguishes pneumonic, bubonic, and carbuncular
types of the disease. He mentions cervical and axillary,
but not inguinal buboes, and also the dark patches on the
skin, that later came to be termed ‘tokens’. He also asserts
the incidence of the disease on the domestic animals.</p>

<p>In making for Genoa these ships put in at Messina in Sicily
and left the infection there. Michael Platiensis (of Piazza),
a Franciscan friar, has given an account of its course in this
city. He refers to infection by means of the breath, and by
contact with the belongings of, the infected. Gabrielle de
Mussi seems to hold a similar belief. ‘We’ [i. e. the Genoese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
sailors], he says, ‘reach our homes: our kindred and our
neighbours come from all parts to visit us. Woe to us, for
we cast at them the darts of death! Whilst we spoke to
them, whilst they embraced us and kissed us, we scattered the
poison from our lips. Going back to their homes, they soon
infected their whole families.’</p>

<p>De Mussi explicitly asserts that the plague was carried
from the seaport of Genoa by some Genoese to Bobbio, and
to his city of Piacenza. Here such was the mortality that
‘no prayer was said, no solemn office sung, nor bell tolled
for the funeral of even the noblest citizen: but by day and
night the corpses were borne to the common plague pit
without rite or ceremony’.</p>

<p>So Italy had been primarily infected at Venice and at
Genoa, and from these sea-coast cities the disease spread
itself over the whole Italian peninsula.</p>

<p>At Venice the example of Galen had sunk deep into the
hearts of her physicians. They fled before the advancing
enemy and shut themselves up in their houses, leaving the
surgeons, led by Andrea di Padova, to fill their place.
Physicians would do well to bear this occasion in mind,
when they complain of the encroachments of surgery into
the domain of medicine. On March 30, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348, the Grand
Council of Venice appointed three men to act as a Committee
of Public Safety. These men had large burial-pits dug in one
of the islands of the lagoon, and organized a service of boats
to transport the bodies to them.</p>

<p>Rome was not so hard hit as some of the cities of Italy.
Nevertheless, there remains to this day a monument of this
plague in the flight of marble steps leading up to the church
of Ara Coeli. These were set up by Giovanni de Colonna in
October 1348, out of the spoils of the temple of the Sun on
the Quirinal, and were designed for the use of the citizens,
who with ropes round their necks and with ashes on their
heads climbed the hill barefooted, to implore from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
Blessed Virgin the cessation of the plague. The thirteenth-century
mosaic of the Madonna and Child may still be seen
above the side entrance of Ara Coeli at the head of the well-worn
stairs leading up from the Capitoline Piazza. The
object of worship remains, but the worshippers are no more.</p>

<p>Lanciani<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> has reproduced an old engraving showing
women ascending the marble stairs on their knees. This
staircase would seem to be indicated both in Delaunay’s
picture and in the fresco by which it was inspired.</p>

<p>There is a legend in Rome, that as the panic-stricken
people were carrying an effigy of the Madonna from the
Ara Coeli to St. Peter’s, the statue of the angel on the
Castel S. Angelo bowed its head to do homage to it.</p>

<p>Plague was not the only enemy in Rome in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348, for
a terrible earthquake on September 9 and 10 wrought havoc
among the remaining monuments of ancient Rome. Those
citizens, who had escaped the plague and from death among
the falling ruins, lived for weeks in the open Campagna
with no shelter from the inclemency of the weather. Perhaps
it was this accident that served to bring the visitation to an
end at Rome more rapidly than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Agnolo di Tura, in his <i>Cronica Senese</i>, edited by Muratori,
gives a graphic picture of the Black Death in Siena. A large
uninteresting picture in the church of S. Maria dei Servi
depicts St. Catharine attending the plague-stricken, and
there is an ugly, almost ludicrous, fresco of the same subject
in the House of St. Catharine of Siena. The painter brothers
Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti were both carried off by
plague. But it is in the Duomo itself that the mark of the
Black Death is most apparent. Begun in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1339, on the
site of an older cathedral dedicated to the Madonna of the
Assumption, the transepts were built, the foundations of the
nave and choir were laid, and their walls partly raised
according to the designs of Lando Orefice, when the Black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Death broke out in the city in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348. The money
collected for the building was diverted to urgent public
purposes, and the work, once suspended, has never been
completely accomplished. The present cathedral, splendid
as it is, is a mere fragment of the magnificent fabric, in which
Orefice purposed to enshrine a memorial to the glory of
fourteenth-century Siena.</p>

<p>The little Cappella di Piazza, attached as a loggia to the
Palazzo Publico of Siena, was set up in gratitude for the
cessation of the plague that carried off no less than thirty
thousand persons. It was commenced in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1352 and
completed in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1376. Hard by Siena the citizens of San
Gimignano vowed an altar to St. Fabian and St. Sebastian
as the price of their protection, and set it up between the
doors of the Pieve or Collegiata. Above the place where once
it stood is now the fresco of Benozzo Gozzoli, commemorating
the plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1464.</p>

<p>No less a man than Petrarch<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> has chronicled this plague at
Parma. His letter is in no sense descriptive, but rather
a long-drawn-out wail over the devastation, the loss of
friends and relations, and the magnitude of the destruction,
that seemed to him to threaten the utter extinction of the
human race. Affectation is the key-note of his lamentations,
that are freely interspersed with allusions to the ancient
classics. Laura had died of plague at Avignon in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348,
and Petrarch in sadness of soul wrote these lines on the
manuscript of his beloved Vergil, now in the Ambrosian
Library at Milan:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Laura, illustrious by her virtues, and long celebrated in
my songs, first greeted my eyes in the days of my youth,
the 6th April, 1327, at Avignon; and in the same city, at the
same hour of the same 6th April, but in the year 1348,
withdrew from life, whilst I was at Verona, unconscious of
my loss. The melancholy truth was made known to me by
letters, which I received at Parma on the 19th May.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>‘Her chaste and lovely body was interred on the evening
of the same day in the Church of the Minorites: her soul,
as I believe, returned to heaven, whence it came.’</p>

<p>‘To write these lines in bitter memory of this event, and
in the place where they will most often meet my eyes, has
in it something of a cruel sweetness, but I forget that nothing
more ought in this life to please me, which by the grace of
God need not be difficult to one who thinks strenuously and
manfully of the idle cares, the empty hopes, and the unexpected
end of the years that are gone.’</p>

</div>

<p>The Florentines, by way of rehabilitating their city after
the Black Death, founded a university, and offered Petrarch
a professorial chair, which he declined.</p>

<p>Matteo Villani<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> wrote a plain unvarnished account of the
state of Florence during the Black Death, but it has found
little favour beside the lighter sketch that stands as a prelude
to the <i>Decameron</i>. His brother Giovanni, the Florentine
historian, was one of the early victims, and Matteo takes up
his history at the point at which he left it, and begins with
a description of the epidemic. Famine had preceded the
plague, and like it was regarded as sent by Heaven for the
punishment of sin. But the energy of the government, in
importing corn and distributing it to the destitute, had done
much to relieve the distress, when this worse enemy presented
itself at the gates.</p>

<p>Both Villani and Boccaccio enlarge on the futility of all
measures, preventive and remedial alike, and the intense
infectiveness of the disease. They believed that it could be
communicated by a look, as well as by contact with the
person or belongings of an infected subject. Boccaccio
mentions the speedy death of two pigs from rooting among
some infected clothing. Some pinned their faith on strict
seclusion: some on temperate living, some on intemperance:
others sought safety in the carrying of aromatic substances.
Both Villani and Boccaccio lay stress on the utter depravity
and demoralization engendered by the plague. Great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
uncertainty of life has never failed to generate corresponding
recklessness. It has always been the same tale in every
desperate city; it was so when Jerusalem, panic-stricken
at the threatened attack of Sennacherib, gave itself over to
wild revelry: ‘And in that day did the Lord God of Hosts
call to weeping and to mourning, and to baldness, and to
girding with sackcloth: but behold joy and gladness, slaying
oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let
us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.’ Matteo Villani
traces to the Black Death the social and moral degeneracy
and the political anarchy, that were rampant in Florentine
life, in the centuries that followed close upon it. Family
affection is apt to reach its lowest ebb in the houses of
a plague-stricken city. Villani and Boccaccio echo the
language of Thucydides when they tell of parents deserting
children, and husbands wives, in their hour of need, and the
neglect of the sacred rites of sepulture. The plague raged in
Florence from April to September, and Antoninus, Archbishop
of Florence, computes the mortality within the city
at 60,000 persons, two-thirds of the total population.
Boccaccio actually raises the figure to 100,000 between
March and July only, but this figure, if correct, must comprise
also the surrounding district, which suffered only less
severely than the city itself. One bright record stands out
against this dark background of social demoralization in the
devotion of the Compagnia della Misericordia to their self-appointed
task. Instituted in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1244 for the service of
the sick, they now also lent themselves to the transport of
the dead. A picture by Cigoli (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1559-1613), now in the
church of the Misericordia, shows the brotherhood in red
robes—now changed to black—gathering up the dead and
dying at the foot of Giotto’s Tower. The bearers may be
seen to this day in the streets of Florence in the same robes
and hoods masking the whole face but the eyes, but the
hand-litters and sedans of Cigoli’s picture have now been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
slung on wheels and sanctified to modern use with the
addition of a motor ambulance. Great wealth flowed
into the coffers of the guild from men who desired to
crown a vicious life with a comfortable death and a decent
burial.</p>

<p>The horrors of the plague-stricken city, with which
Boccaccio has prefaced his <i>Decameron</i>, stand out in striking
contrast to the gay frivolity of the young men and women
round whom his romance ranges. Plague and pleasure jostle
each other in jarring juxtaposition. Boccaccio of set purpose
chose this dark background for the staging of his brighter
theme. Thucydides had done the same before him, in setting
the panegyric of Pericles side by side with the plague of
Athens: and Manzoni has done so after him in the romance
of <i>Promessi Sposi</i>. Perhaps also he had learnt, amid the
fierce realities of the plague, to envisage life as it is, and so
present it to his readers.</p>

<p>Niebuhr, in tracing the decadence of Roman literature
to the Antonine plague, cites as a parallel illustration the
influence of the Black Death on early Florentine literature.
In the latter case, at any rate, it is difficult to bring his dictum
into line with the actual circumstances. It would seem rather
that the break in the vernacular Florentine literature after
Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, was deliberate, and in no
sense accidental. What Petrarch perceived, and perceived
unerringly, was the poverty of the material on which the
vernacular had maintained a starved existence; and he saw
in the ancient classics, in their mythology, in their speculative
freedom, in the principles of their art, liberation from
the bondage that the Church had laid on literature. What
he did not perceive was that in reverting to ancient modes
of thought it was needless, nay even harmful, to adopt also
the language of the ancients. It was not open to him to see,
as it is to us, that no great work of literature has ever been
produced in any language but that in which the writer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
speaks and feels and thinks: any tongue but the tongue of
his daily life must needs be artificial and inanimate. Petrarch
himself little guessed that with posterity his fame would rest
on his <i>Rime</i> in the vernacular, and not on his epistles and
multifarious dissertations in a lifeless Latin language. It
is this mistaken teaching of Petrarch that explains the abrupt
break of a century or more in vernacular Florentine literature,
to which the Black Death can have been at most
a trivial contributory cause. As soon as this mistake came
to be recognized Florentine literature flows on again in its
old channel in the full stream of the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century
masterpieces of Ariosto, of Tasso, and the rest. It
was the advice of Petrarch that turned Boccaccio from the
vernacular to Latin, after he had completed in his <i>Decameron</i>
a masterpiece of Italian prose. The influence of the classical
revival that Petrarch had brought to life was destined also
slowly to secularize Florentine art, but the time of its complete
emancipation was not yet.</p>

<p>The Black Death first touched French soil at Marseilles,
brought thither, it was thought, by ships from Genoa.
Simon de Covino, a doctor, described the features of the
disease as he witnessed it at the neighbouring town of
Montpellier, in Latin hexameter verse. He clearly recognized
its contagious character, for he says, ‘By a single touch or
a single breath of the plague-stricken they perished.’</p>

<p>Of the plague at Avignon both lay and medical accounts
survive. A full description is contained in a letter from an
anonymous canon to his friends in Bruges. He remarks on
the virulence of the contagion, and describes both pneumonic
and bubonic types of the disease. He says that Clement VI
ordered bodies to be examined after death, in the hope of
discovering the origin of the disease. This fact should be
noted by those who assert that the Church interpreted the
<i>De Sepulturis</i> bull of Boniface VIII (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1300) as prohibiting
the anatomy of human bodies. The autopsies disclosed no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
more than inflammation of the lungs in the pneumonic cases.
Similar examinations, previously undertaken in Italy, had
also yielded no better result. Clement also ordained expiatory
processions and penitential litanies. Within the
precincts of his palace, to which his medical attendant,
Gui de Chauliac, confined him, he lent his own presence to the
whole ceremonial that he prescribed. But he did not
neglect to keep large fires alight in his apartments, as
Pope Nicholas IV (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1288-92) had done at Rome in
a previous visitation. Only those who have been at Avignon
at midsummer can appreciate the price that Clement was
ready to pay for immunity.</p>

<p>Clement’s physician, Gui de Chauliac, says that the
plague began at Avignon in January, and lasted for seven
months.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In his view the causes of the pandemic were twofold:
universal, consisting in a conjunction of the planets:
and special, dependent on the feeble constitution of the
individual, whereby it came about that labouring men were
chiefly attacked. But then as now the scared populace was
proof against pontifical pronouncements from the Chair of
Medicine. They saw in it the handiwork of Jews spreading
poison throughout the world, so they put them to death.
They saw in it malevolence of lepers, so they drove them
out. They saw in it a plot of feudal overlords for their
extinction, so they remained within their houses. And for
completer security they set a guard around the towns and
villages, who accosted each newcomer and compelled him
to swallow any ointments or powders found upon him.</p>

<p>De Chauliac describes two prevalent types of the disease.
The one type, the pneumonic, prevailed only for the first
two months, and was characterized by spitting of blood,
extreme infectiousness, and death in three days. The
second type, the bubonic, prevailed throughout the five
succeeding months, and was characterized by boils, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
buboes chiefly in the armpits and groins, by slight infectiousness,
and death in five days. The mortality extended to no
less than three-fourths of the total population, so that to
get rid of the bodies they were driven to throw them into the
Rhone, after Clement had pronounced a blessing on its
waters.</p>

<p>To Gui de Chauliac the best of all preservatives was flight,
aided, or perhaps we should say embarrassed, by the free
use of aloetic purgatives.</p>

<p>He did not fly himself, for he says, with the <i>naïveté</i> of
a Pepys, ‘As for me, to avoid infamy, I did not dare absent
myself, but still I was in continual fear.’ (Et moy pour
euiter infamie, n’osay point m’absâter: mais auec continuelle
peur me preseruay tant que ie peux, moyennant les susdicts
remedes.) His hesitancy was to prove his undoing, for he
was himself infected towards the end of the epidemic—but
recovered after six weeks. Among other preservatives he
reckons venesection, purification of the air by means of
fires, comforting the heart with treacle and apples and things
of savoury flavour, consoling the humours with Galen’s
Armenian bole, and the prevention of putrefaction by the
use of bitter things. Should the disease defy all these precautions,
then he commends, as curative measures, bleedings
and evacuations, with electuaries and cordial syrups.
Buboes should be ripened with poultices of figs and boiled
onions, pounded and mixed with leaven and butter: then
they should be opened and treated like ulcers. Carbuncles
are to be leeched, scarified, and cauterized—an improvement
on the disastrous treatment meted out to Felix, bishop of
Nantes, on a previous occasion.</p>

<p>Raymond Chalin de Vinario, another practitioner in
Avignon during the plague, adds but little to what Gui de
Chauliac has to say. He describes a solid cord, red or
variously discoloured, which appeared in some cases on the
body surface, with a carbuncle at one end and a pestilential<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
tubercle at the other. This can hardly have been anything
else than an acute lymphangitis.</p>

<p>It is clear from the descriptions of the various writers
that a large proportion of the cases in this pandemic
were of pneumonic type: hence its virulence and its infectiousness.</p>

<p>Amid all the panic of the Black Death, persecution of the
Jews broke out with even greater ferocity than during the
Crusades in the twelfth century. Some victim was needed
to appease the maddened populace: so the Jews were
accused of poisoning the wells, and even of infecting the air.
Circumstantial accounts were circulated throughout Europe
of secret operations directed from Toledo. The concoction of
poisons from spiders, owls, and other supposed venomous
animals was described, and its mode of distribution made
known. So well did their accusers deceive themselves that
in many places the springs and wells were sealed, so that no
one might use them, and the inhabitants of many cities had
to rely on rain and river water. If confirmation of poison
were ever needed, the rack could be trusted to procure it:
or, failing that, men could be found vile enough to deposit
poison in places in which circumstances demanded its
presence. Those who escaped the fury of the mob fell
into the clutches of an inexorable justice. In the case
of the Jews the suspicion of poisoning was prompted by
the fact that at this time the practice of medicine, at
any rate in southern Europe, was chiefly in the hands
of Jewish physicians. Hideous massacres of Jews had
taken place in southern France and Spain in the previous
epidemics of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1320 and 1333, as we know from the
writings of Rabbi Joshua.</p>

<p>The first outbreak of murderous ferocity seems to have
occurred at Chillon, on the Lake of Geneva, in September and
October, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1348. Here it was merely the culmination of
an accusation of poisoning the wells so long previously as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the epidemic of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1320. In face of the common danger,
high and low bound themselves together by a solemn oath to
extirpate the Jews by fire and the sword. Chillon summoned
Bern, and Bern sent on the summons to Basle, Freyburg,
and Strasbourg to join them in their righteous task. The
record of confessions extracted from the Jews by the ordeal
of torture within the Castle of Chillon has been rescued from
oblivion by the vigilance of Hecker.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> In Basle and Freyburg
the Jews were seized, one and all, and without form of trial
were burnt to death in a wooden building, specially constructed
for the purpose, while at Strasbourg no less than
two thousand Jews were immolated on a wooden scaffold,
erected in their own burial-ground. Such as escaped were
ruthlessly murdered in the streets, saving a few only to whom
freedom was granted on submission to baptism. But for
these the respite from renewed accusation and death was
only temporary. Faithlessness to their own religion, or
physical charms sufficient to assuage the blood-lust of their
Christian persecutors, constituted the only acceptable claims
to a passing mercy. Strasbourg betrayed the true ground of
its hatred of the Jews in an order of its senate that all pledges
and bonds should be returned to the debtors and the money
divided among the working-people. Those who were unwilling
to soil their hands with blood-money presented their
share of the spoils to monasteries, at the prompting of their
confessors. At Spires, Mayence, and Eslingen, voluntary
immolation in their own houses alone saved the Jews from
more inhuman tortures. Some were murdered in the open
streets and their dead bodies thrown into the Rhine in
empty casks, so that they might not infect the air. Now
and again banishment was substituted for burning, only for
the outcasts to perish at the hands of a savage and bloodthirsty
countryfolk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>When the houses of the Jews were burnt a ban was set
on entry into the ruins of their habitations: the site was
accursed, as the site of Jericho of old. But the bricks of the
destroyed dwellings and the tombstones of the victims were
in due time rendered as an acceptable thank-offering to God
in the repair of Christian churches. In Austria the same
accusations were brought against the Jews as elsewhere, and
numbers were burnt to death in Vienna and throughout the
country. Where there were no Jews, as in Leipsic, Magdeburg,
and other places, the grave-diggers were accused of
propagating the plague for their own sordid ends.</p>

<p>It should be set to the credit of Clement VI that he
extended his personal protection to the Jews at Avignon,
issuing two bulls, asserting their innocence, and calling
on Christians to refrain from persecution. The Emperor
Charles IV did what lay in his power, short of drawing
the sword, to check the outrages perpetrated by the
Bohemian nobles. Duke Albert of Austria exacted from
the persecutors punishments only less cruel than they themselves
had inflicted, but even so did not avail to save hundreds
of Jews from the flames, in his own fortress of Kyberg.
Other lesser princes, more often for bribes than for pity,
extended some measure of protection to the wretched Jews,
earning for themselves the <i>sobriquet</i> of ‘Jew-masters’. It
was no light matter for a private person to shelter a Jew,
for the penalty was often exacted on the rack or at the
stake.</p>

<p>Basnage<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> states that the large number of Jews in modern
Poland may be traced to the fact that King Casimir the
Great (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1333-70), yielding to the entreaties of a favourite
Jewess, Esther, granted sanctuary to such Jews as sought it.
But actually Casimir only confirmed an edict of protection
promulgated in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1264, and Poland had then already
afforded a haven of refuge to the Jews, who had fled from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
cruel massacres perpetrated in the enthusiasm of the first
Crusade.</p>

<p>In England the Black Death served to revive the perennial
charges brought against the Jews—that they stole Christian
children and killed them, especially at Easter-time, a charge
that Chaucer, mindful of Hugh of Lincoln, has enshrined
in the pathetic verse of his Prioress. They were charged
also with outraging the Host, as well as with spreading
poison.</p>

<p>The Black Death seems to have fallen with greater violence
on Austria than on Germany,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> perhaps on account of its close
contact with Italy. It devastated Vienna from Easter to
Michaelmas of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1349, carrying off thirty thousand out of
a population of less than one hundred thousand persons.
The excited populace personified it as the Pest-Jungfrau,
who had only to raise her hand to infect a victim. She was
to be seen flying through the air in the form of a blue flame,
and also proceeding out of the mouths of dead and dying.
Some saw the plague poison descend in the form of a ball of
fire. One such was seen hovering over the town, but a bishop
exorcised it by prayer, so that it fell harmless to earth.
A stone effigy of the Madonna was set up in the street, where
it fell. All medical aid proved useless, and amulets, potions,
and preservative electuaries were in general use. Segregation
of the sick was attempted, by nailing up doors and
windows of infected houses, but even so dead bodies littered
the streets. Huge plague pits were dug for the reception
of the dead. Flagellant processions sought to excite divine
compassion by the ritual of peripatetic penitence.</p>

<p>The genesis of the Flagellant movement must be looked
for further back in the history of pestilence than the Black
Death. The idea of mortifying the flesh by the penance of
scourging is of ancient origin, and at least as early as the
eleventh century brotherhoods were devoted to this ritual.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
The processions of these <i>Devoti</i>, as they were termed in
Italy, were originated by St. Anthony in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1231, and we
hear of them under the name of Flagellants in Vienna during
the plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1261.</p>

<p>One Monachus Paduanus, quoted by Hecker, has left
a record of the early days of the <i>Devoti</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘When the land was polluted by vices and crimes, an
unexampled spirit of remorse suddenly seized the minds of
the Italians. The fear of Christ fell upon all: noble and
ignoble, old and young, and even children of five years of
age, marched through the streets with no covering but a scarf
round the waist. They each carried a scourge of leather
thongs, which they applied to their limbs, amid sighs and
tears, with such violence that the blood flowed from the
wounds. Not only during the day, but even by night, and
in the severest winter, they traversed the cities with burning
torches and banners, in thousands and tens of thousands,
headed by their priests, and prostrated themselves before
the altars. They proceeded in the same manner in the
villages: and the woods and mountains resounded with the
voices of those whose cries were raised to God. The
melancholy chaunt of the penitent alone was heard.
Enemies were reconciled: men and women vied with each
other in splendid works of charity, as if they dreaded that
Divine Omnipotence would pronounce on them the doom of
annihilation.’</p>

</div>

<p>Before this mediaeval pageant of penitence the mind
insensibly reverts to the ancient ritual of the Salii on this
same Italian soil, to their choric hymn of expiation, to the
<i>supplicationes</i>, and to the love-feast of the <i>lectisternium</i> of
later days.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus of the Black Death, the Brotherhood
of the Cross, or Cross-bearers, arose out of the ranks of the
Flagellants, first in Hungary, and afterwards in Germany.
Ditmar<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> has left the following account of their processions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Their heads covered as far as the eyes: their look
fixed on the ground, accompanied by every token of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
deepest contrition and mourning. They were robed in sombre
garments, with red crosses on the breast, back and cap,
and bore triple scourges, tied in three or four knots, in which
points of iron were fixed. Tapers and magnificent banners
of cloth of gold were carried before them: wherever they
made their appearance they were welcomed by the ringing of
the bells: and the people flocked from all quarters, to
listen to their hymns and to witness their penance, with
devotion and tears.’</p>

</div>

<p>When the Flagellants entered the town they would hand
the citizens a document setting forth God’s anger and
determination to destroy mankind, had not the Virgin Mary
interceded for them. Some of the crosses carried by the
Flagellants are still to be seen at Gross-Glogau, Kaysersberg,
and Ammerschweyer in Upper Alsace.</p>

<p>This spirit of religious fanaticism spread like wildfire
through Hungary, Germany, Bohemia, Silesia, Poland, and
Flanders, and even beyond these countries. In the autumn
of 1349 some six-score Flagellants crossed from Holland and
paraded the streets of London, but the metropolis had not
then acquired the taste for processions, and ejected them as
undesirable aliens. At last the movement had alighted on
uncongenial soil. So great was the number of the Flagellants
that they became a cause of well-founded anxiety to the
clergy, whose churches they actually invaded, and whose
influence they threatened to supersede. Their hymns were
in every mouth, and one of them, the chief psalm of the
Cross-bearers, is reproduced by Hecker in his <i>Epidemics of
the Middle Ages</i>.</p>

<p>The secular authorities also saw cause for alarm at the
growing numbers and power of the brotherhood, bound
together by common ritual and common regulations, and
capable, under bold and designing leaders, of exerting their
influence in the affairs of states. The Emperor Charles IV
appealed to the Holy See for protection against the heretics,
and Clement VI responded by issuing a bull from Avignon
on October 20, 1349, prohibiting the pilgrimages on pain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
of excommunication. Philip VI forbade altogether their
reception in France, and several other ruling princes followed
his example. Relentless persecution soon took the place of
unthinking homage. The processions were abandoned, but
the spirit that animated them was not dead, and the same
fanaticism broke out again in Germany in the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries, and in Italy even as late as the
eighteenth, under the influence of successive plagues.</p>

<p>The Black Death, sweeping throughout England, is
believed to have carried off one-half of the total population.
Historians have told the tale of the resulting emancipation of
the labouring class, but we find that it has also left its mark
on the education, the literature, the art, and the architecture
of England.</p>

<p>In education, it helped greatly to bring about the revival
of English in the schools. After the Norman Conquest
French had gradually become the language of education:
not of set purpose, for the Conqueror himself tried ineffectually
to learn English. But most of the education was in
the hands of the clergy, and as many Frenchmen had been
put in charge of monasteries and of parochial cures, it
was inevitable that French should become the language
of education, and so diffuse itself generally through the
educated part of the nation, both French and English. About
the middle of the fourteenth century Higden, in his <i>Polychronicon</i>,
states that French was still the language taught
in the schools, and had been so since the Norman Conquest.
In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1385 Trevisa, commenting on Higden’s statement,
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘This maner was myche yused tofore the first moreyn
[before the 1349 murrain], and is siththe som dele [since
somewhat] ychaungide. For John Cornwaile, a maister of
gramer, chaungide the lore [learning] in gramer scole and
construction of [from] Frensch into Englisch, and Richard
Pencriche lerned that maner teching of him, and other men
of Pencriche. So that now, the yere of owre Lord a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
thre hundred foure score and fyve, of the secunde King
Rychard after the Conquest nyne, in alle the gramer scoles
of England children leveth Frensch, and construeth an
[in] Englisch.’</p>

</div>

<p>Despite the adoption of French as the language of the
schools, English had survived as a colloquial language
side by side with its supplanter. In the conflict between
the two prestige and fashion were on the side of French,
tradition and nationality on the side of English: and
sooner or later the balance was bound to incline to the side
of the national language. The fusion of the two had inevitably
led to the corruption of each, but the corrupted French,
at any rate after the loss of Normandy, had no standard of
purity at hand to limit corruption, while the corrupted English
was constantly purified by contact with the native tongue,
and by the existence of a pre-Norman vernacular literature.
National spirit, stimulated by international strife, was
ripe for completing the task, that John Cornwall had begun
in a single west country school; and the Black Death, by
sweeping away the existing teachers and making place for
others of native stock, did much to facilitate the change.
The triumph of the vernacular operated a mighty revolution
in our national literature, paving the way for Langland and
Chaucer. Thomas Usk, in the Prologue to his <i>Testament of
Love</i>, completed not later than <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1387, alludes to the
utter corruption of the imported French, and the Prioress
in the Canterbury Tales, although she could speak French
‘ful fayre and festishly’ spoke it only</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For Frenche of Paris was to hire [her] unknowe.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>One other immediate effect of the Black Death was to
reduce the literary output of the monasteries to its lowest
level. No one can fail to be struck by the scantiness and
sterility of the contemporary chronicles, which characterize
the period following the Black Death, and the reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
explanation of this abrupt change would seem to lie in the
notorious depletion of the monastic households. The
tragedy of the Provençal brotherhood, in which Petrarch’s
brother and his dog alone survived to tend and guard the
monastery, found an echo in a like desolation of many an
English monastery. The special incidence on the monasteries
was perhaps due to the monks moving freely among the sick,
and giving them sanctuary within their cloister. The sick,
too, exhibited often an ill-timed gratitude in bequeathing
their clothes to the monasteries. Doctors, as Chaucer
remarked of his day, were only for the rich.</p>

<p>In England, as in Italy, the Black Death left its mark on
architecture in the abrupt arrest of schemes of construction
in course of execution. Many such breaks may be detected
in the church architecture of the fourteenth century, and
a notable example is furnished in the unfinished towers of the
church of St. Nicholas at Yarmouth.</p>

<p>Prior<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> indicates a similar break of continuity in the
building of York Minster. The west front and the nave
were in course of construction, when the Black Death
appeared, and the result is a makeshift wood vaulting to
the nave. Then the building of the choir was delayed for
twelve years, till <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1361, and in its structure the flowing
lines of the Decorated style, seen in the west front, have
given place to the formal stiffness of the Perpendicular.</p>

<p>In London the effect is much less conspicuous than in
the northern parts of England, perhaps because it was
easier to replenish the supply of masons in the metropolis
than elsewhere. The building of St. Stephen’s Chapel in
Westminster and the completion of the Abbey cloisters
seem to have proceeded continuously, and with no change
of style, throughout the Black Death and the following
years: and the same is the case with Gloucester Cathedral.</p>

<p>Prior considers that the Black Death played a leading<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
part in the superseding of the Decorated by the Perpendicular
type, and in the diffusion of the latter from its Gloucester
home throughout England. The lack of builders led to
masons passing from one district to another, removing them
from the conditions of local stone favourable to their
best work and to originality of style. The inevitable result
was that the architectural style easiest of expression in any
form of stone was bound to prevail, and that style was the
Perpendicular. Examples of this transformation in the
years following close on the Black Death are numerous, in
the nave and cloisters of Canterbury Cathedral, in the west
front of Winchester Cathedral, and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The same stereotyped monotony, the same continuous
decline in the skill of execution, the same obvious diminution
of interest in the craft of the artificer, as is seen in the
building construction, are manifest also in the figure-sculpture
and traceries of the period. The variation of artistic
expression, that in the two preceding centuries had progressed
steadily from strength to strength, comes to an
abrupt cessation, and is content with the incessant repetition
of inanimate models.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The figure-sculpture<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> of the later mediaeval church
under such conditions grew to be especially of the shop,
according to pattern and not of fresh adventure. It no longer
took its place in the business of the building-yard, but was
provided for—not worked—in the building. The constructing
mason left niches for statues, and on occasion
worked bosses with subject relief, cornices with ‘angel’
sculpture, and gargoyles with ‘devil’ sculpture. But this
figure work was not essential, and a whole majestic piece
of architecture in Perpendicular style might rise from the
ground and never ask for the craft of the figure-sculptor
at all. The works of the imager were now in effect furniture,
which could be bought in the city and added to the building
at any time. Accordingly statues and reliefs ceased, in
fifteenth-century practice, to be carved immediately by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
the mason upon the building: they became outside works
conceived in no intimate relation to it.’</p>

</div>

<p>Gasquet maintains that a similar breach of continuity
may be observed in the manufacture of stained glass, and
that there is a noticeable change in style after the Black
Death. Speaking broadly, the styles of stained glass correspond
to the styles of architecture, but in each case are a little
later: so that the contention comes to this, that there is an
unbridged gap between the late Decorated and early
Perpendicular. Yet one cannot but recall the ante-chapel
windows of New College, Oxford, and the east window of
Gloucester Cathedral, in each of which the transition from
Decorated to Perpendicular is apparent.</p>

</div>

<p>For three centuries and more after the Black Death plague
was endemic throughout central and southern Europe,
and its presence is indelibly recorded in the productions
of contemporary art. Dances of Death, plague banners,
votive and commemorative paintings, and actual representations
of plague scenes all bear silent testimony to the
abiding presence of the enemy within the gates. <i>Memento
mori</i>, with its dismal foreboding, was the appropriate
motto of the age. Innocent III in his <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i>
had said the last word on the misery of human existence,
and the shame and degradation of the human body, polluted
and polluting, long before the Black Death: but henceforward
the gloom that haunted the soul of this great
successor of St. Peter seems to diffuse itself throughout the
world.</p>

<p>Dancing from early ages has been associated with the
conception of death. In many primitive races these dances
seem to pertain to mimetic magic, and purport to expedite
the passing of the spirit of the deceased. Both Greeks and
Romans preserved dancing in their funeral celebrations,
and representations of these funeral dances have been
found in connexion with Greek and Etruscan tombs. These
are commonly a file of maidens, holding each other’s hands,
and led by a youthful male coryphaeus. Anacreon,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Tibullus,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
and Vergil<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> all depict the revelry of the dance in the land of
departed souls, and joy is the key-note of the dance. Christianity,
in superseding paganism, for better or for worse
inculcated a gloomy conception of death, as a punishment,
a penalty for original sin. Recurrent epidemics of pestilence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
served to transform the conception into that of an inexorable
foe revelling in the subversion of human happiness and the
futility of human affairs. The literature of the age no less
than its art bears the imprint of this conception. Petrarch
has left us a <i>Triumph of Death</i>, and Langland in his <i>Vision
of Piers Plowman</i><a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> has given us in verse a Dance of Death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Death came driving after, and all to dust pashed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Kynges and Knightes, Kaysers and Popes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Learned and lewde: he ne let no man stande;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That he hitte even, stirred never after.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a lovely ladie and her lemmans of knightes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Swouned and swelte for sorwe of Death’s dyntes.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The earliest authenticated painting of the Death-dance
is that which was once to be seen in the churchyard of the
Innocents at Paris, painted in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1434, but it is improbable
that it was actually the first. A closely similar theme of
earlier date may still be seen in the Campo Santo at Pisa.
Vasari attributed it to Andrew Orcagna (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1329-68),
but modern critics believe it to have been painted by
Pisan artists, about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1350. This fresco shows three
young men following the chase on horseback. Coming to
the cell of St. Macarius, an Egyptian anchorite, they are
brought face to face with three open coffins, in which are
a skeleton and two dead bodies, reminding them of the
fleeting nature of human pleasures. This subject also is one
adopted from contemporary literature. Under the title of ‘Les
trois Morts et les trois Vifs’ it had figured in thirteenth-century
verse, and is frequently illustrated in the manuscript <i>Horae</i> of
the period. It is suggested that this legend is the origin of
the name ‘Danse macabre’, or ‘Macaber Dance’, used often
as an alternative name for the familiar ‘Dance of Death’.</p>

<p class="caption">DANCE OF DEATH, AT BASLE</p>

<p class="caption-r">(Face <a href="#Page_135">Page 135</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>It is not in Italy and not in France, but rather, as we should
expect, in Germany and Switzerland, that these Dances of
Death found most favour, as befits the countries that gave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
birth to Luther and shelter to Calvin. In 1462-3 plague
raged fiercely at Lübeck. In the chapel at the east end of
the Marienkirche is a much restored ‘Dance of Death’,
dated 1463, and showing the costumes of the period. It
is interesting as being considerably older than the more
famous Basle Dance.</p>

<p>By far the most celebrated ‘Dance of Death’ was that
painted in a shed in the churchyard of the Dominican
convent at Basle. It is believed to have been painted in
commemoration of a plague that occurred during the
session of the Grand Council of Basle, that lasted from
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1431 to 1443. It has been attributed on insufficient
evidence to Holbein. It was destroyed by a riotous mob
in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1806, but relics of the life-size figures, painted in
oil, are still to be seen in the Historical Museum at Basle.
Engravings of it also exist that record its characters in
detail. Holbein did actually paint a ‘Dance of Death’ in
fresco on the walls of the old Whitehall Palace, which was
destroyed in the fire of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1697. It was an appropriate
subject for the brush of an artist, who himself was to die of
plague (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1554). It is probably referred to by Matthew
Prior in his <i>Ode to the Memory of George Villiers</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Our term of life depends not on our deed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before our birth our funeral was decreed,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Peoples great Henry’s tombs, and leads up Holbein’s Dance.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Holbein was almost certainly also the author of the
originals of the Lyons ‘Dance of Death’, from which Hans
Lutzenberger engraved the woodcuts, which represent
a varied assortment of characters of each and every social
order, among whom Death, in grotesque guise, plies his
grim and gruesome task.</p>

<p>The most casual observer cannot fail to be struck in any
collection of pictures of the Holbein School, with the number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
that present some aspect or other of death. In the small
picture gallery of Basle there is a picture of two skulls and
a tibia, by Ambrose Holbein: a diptych, with the bust of
a young man on one panel, and a skeleton on the other,
by Hans Holbein the Younger: another sixteenth-century
diptych with a bust of a girl on one panel, and a bust of
a skeleton on the other, by an unknown painter: and two
pictures by Hans Baldung (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1475-1545), one of Death
holding a woman by the hair and pointing to a grave:
the other of Death kissing a woman before an open grave.</p>

<p>Plague banners, or <i>gonfaloni</i>,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> are a characteristic product
of the Umbrian school of painting, and particularly of its
Perugian branch. It was the lot of Perugian painters to
ply their art in the midst of tribulations of every kind.
Throughout the fifteenth century their country was devastated
by war, and by a succession of epidemics of plague
(in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1399, 1418, 1429, 1437, 1450, 1456, 1460-8, 1475-80
and 1486). In the face of these visitations Perugia set herself
to appeal to the mercy of Christ through the medium of her
art. All her painters scarcely sufficed to provide all the
banners required for her expiatory and triumphal processions.
It was at times such as these that the <i>gonfaloni</i> made their
appearance, raised between heaven and earth, as though
to convey to God a splendid manifestation of popular
repentance. Before the suppliant banners marched the
priesthood in their robes, behind them followed a penitent
people, striking their breasts and wailing aloud <i>Misericordia</i>.
At each fresh invasion of plague a new generation of artists,
beginning with Bonfigli (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1420-96) and ending with
Baroccio (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1528-1612), was called upon to produce
afresh these tributes of the popular devotion. The remedy
was well adapted to their sufferings, for these processions
of penitents, traversing the city and following banners, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
displayed the figure of the Redeemer, or the Madonna, or
some other plague saint, produced in their souls such a degree
of spiritual exaltation, as made despondency impossible.
Men gazed on them as they gazed on the Brazen Serpent
that Moses set up in the wilderness. A striking banner is
that by Bonfigli, in the church of S. Fiorenzo at Perugia,
painted in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1476 during an epidemic of plague. Above
kneels the Madonna: before her stands the Child in a basket
of roses upheld by angels, wearing chaplets of roses, as in
most of Bonfigli’s pictures. Both Madonna and Child are
crowned. Below kneel groups of citizens, men and women,
with Sebastian and other saints, supplicating the Madonna.
An angel holds a scroll, on which is inscribed a fervid call
to repentance, blended with fierce denunciation of their
sins, in these words of Lorenzo Spiriti:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Oh, most obstinate and wicked people—cruel, proud,
and full of all iniquity, who have placed your faith and your
desires on things, which are full of a mortal misery, I, the
angel of Heaven, am sent unto you from God to tell you,
that He will put an end to all your wounds and weeping,
your ruin and your curse through the mediation of Mary....
Turn, turn your eyes, most miserable mortals, to the great
examples of the past and present, to the utter miseries and
heavy evils, which Heaven sends to you because of all your
sins: your homicide and your adultery, your avarice and
luxury.... Oh miserable beings, the justice of heaven
works not in a hurry, but it punishes always, even as men
deserve.... Nineveh was a city florid and magnificent, and
Babylon was likewise, but now they are as nothing: and
Sodom and Gomorrah, behold them now—a morass of
sulphur and of fetid waters.... Oh, therefore, be grateful
and acknowledge the benefits and graces of our Saviour,
and let your souls burn hotly with the fire of faith and charity,
of hope and faithful love.... But and if you should again
grow slothful and unwilling to renounce your errors, I foretell
a second judgement upon you, and I reckon that it will
prove more terrible, more cruel than the first.’<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In banners such as this the imagination of the painter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
finds play for the crowding emotions not of his own heart
only, but of the hearts of his fellow citizens as well.</p>

</div>

<p>Another type of plague banner is that of the ‘Madonna
della Misericordia’ in the church of S. Francesco del Prato
at Perugia, also by Bonfigli. It bears the date <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1464.
In the centre stands the crowned Madonna, a majestic
figure erect like a lighthouse amid the storm, on which
sufferers may fix their eyes and hope. On her garment lie
broken arrows, while beneath its ample folds kneel groups
of monks on one side, and of nuns on the other, all in
attitudes of prayer. In the upper part of the picture
Christ, wearing both crown and cruciferous nimbus, casts
arrows down. At His right hand is the angel of justice with
sword drawn, at His left the angel of mercy with sheathed
sword. Gathered around the Madonna and craving her
intercession are S. Lorenzo and the Bishop SS. Severo,
Costanzo, and Ludovico. Beneath these to the right SS.
Francis and Bernardino, and to the left S. Peter Martyr and
S. Sebastian, whose body is pierced with many arrows.
These saints have Perugia in their special keeping. At the
foot of the picture is shown the city of Perugia, with its
emblematic griffin on the wall. Within the walls a white-robed
confraternity is kneeling in prayer. Without them
lurks Death, a bat-winged skeleton with bow and arrows,
whose victims strew the ground. But the prayers have
prevailed, and already the archangel Raphael strikes Death
with his spear. In the foreground outside the walls is a
fugitive family, the mother mounted on a donkey, carrying
her infants in its paniers. At a side gate two soldiers make
off in haste, as the porter tells them the state of the city.
Perugians say that not Bonfigli but an angel painted the
face of the Madonna. They might well have said it of the
exquisite ‘Madonna del Soccorso’ in Sinibaldo Ibi’s plague
banner of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1482 in the church of S. Francisco at Montone.
This fancy of the protecting Madonna, spreading her robes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
over her suppliants, as a hen gathers her chickens under
her wings, is borrowed from Hebrew poetry. It figures in
a similar conception in the language of the ninety-first
Psalm: ‘I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope and
my stronghold: my God, in Him will I trust. For He shall
deliver thee from the snare of the hunter, and from the
noisome pestilence. He shall defend thee under His wings,
and thou shalt be safe under His feathers.’</p>

<p>One more Madonna banner calls for passing notice—that
of Bonfigli at Corciano near Perugia, dated 1472. It
has the same general character as his ‘Madonna della
Misericordia’. The quaint head-gear of the angels supporting
her robe is the rose-wreath, symbolic of the Madonna,
which appears, in one form or another, in so many of her
pictures.</p>

<p>In nearly all these banners, as in other archaic works,
the dwindling size of individual figures indicates the lesser
parts they have to play. In many the Madonna fills almost
all the banner’s surface.</p>

<p>In another of Bonfigli’s banners in the church of S. Maria
Nuova at Perugia the figure of Christ, wearing a cruciferous
nimbus, dominates the picture. He holds the arrows of
pestilence ready to be launched among the people. His face
is sad and regretful, as He executes faithfully the behests of
His Father. On either side of Him saints bear the emblems
of the Passion, and to the right and left are the darkened
sun and moon. Beside Him kneel the Madonna and the
Franciscan S. Paulinus. In the lowest part of the picture
are the chimneys and towers of Perugia, with the pest-fiend,
in the semblance of a huge bat, bearing a scythe, and the
Angel of Deliverance smiting him with his lance. Below,
shepherded by S. Benedict and S. Scholastica, the diminutive
citizens kneel in prayer.</p>

<p>Yet another type of plague banner is that in which the
figure of a saint plays the leading rôle. The saint is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Sebastian, only because in Umbria and Tuscany he was the
chief accredited protector against pestilence. The finest
example of this type is the S. Sebastian of Sodoma, described
above (pp. 100-1).</p>

<p>Plague banners were not the exclusive product of Umbria.
Two of the most famous, the S. Sebastian of Sodoma
and the Sistine Madonna of Raphael, painted at Siena
and Florence respectively, are products of the Tuscan school:
but it is only in and around Perugia that they can be found
and studied to advantage. The Sistine Madonna, in
which the Madonna and Child are attended by S. Sixtus
and S. Barbara, was painted during an epidemic of pestilence
for the Black Brothers of S. Sisto at Piacenza. No record
exists that it was ever actually used for the purpose for
which it was painted. Bonfigli, in the spirit of Phidias, had
painted ‘Mary the Queen of Heaven’: Raphael, in the
spirit of Praxiteles, had painted ‘Mary the Mother of God’.
The people wanted a queen and Raphael gave them a peasant
woman. They could not see, as Raphael saw, in womanhood
the embodiment of gentleness spiritualizing the brute in
man. They could not see in motherhood the vision of
willing suffering transfigured to joy. It was this reunion of
Art with Nature, that dethroned the plague banner from
the affections of the common people.</p>

<p>Plague banners of less importance are those by Bonfigli
at Civitella Benazzone, by Sinibaldo Ibi in the convent
of S. Ubaldo at Gubbio, dated <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1503, by Giannicola
Manni in the church of S. Dominico at Perugia, dated
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1525, and by Berto di Giovanni in Perugia Cathedral,
dated <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1526. There they will be seen for the most part
as framed altar-pieces.</p>

<p>Perugia’s greatest painter, Pietro Vannucci, better known
as Perugino, perished in the course of one of his city’s plagues.
Tradition has it that he died denying the Saviour and Madonna,
whom his art had done so much to glorify, and that his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
body was thrown into a desolate grave beside a wayside
oak. His sons searched diligently for their father’s body,
to lay it in the church of S. Agostino, but in vain, among
so many that had perished of the plague. It is, said, however,
that a priest found it and buried it under the walls of his
church at Fontignano.</p>

<p>The humbler <i>Pestblätter</i> seem to have played much the
same part in the devotional activities of the individual as
did the <i>gonfaloni</i> in those of the multitude. They were not
exclusively German, but were issued also from the presses
of Flanders, the Netherlands, Italy, and more rarely of
France as well. Pictorial <i>Pestblätter</i> are mostly rough
woodcuts or copper-plate engravings, crudely coloured by
hand in some cases, and belong chiefly to the last two-thirds
of the fifteenth and the first third of the sixteenth centuries.
In the character of their subjects they are usually simply
devotional, and represent some act of expiation or intercession
on behalf of mankind. The three leading types
correspond closely to the three types of <i>gonfaloni</i> in their
subjects:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Christ, the suffering Redeemer, on the cross.</p>

<p>2. Intercession by the Virgin Mary or by Christ.</p>

<p>3. Memorials of the martyrdom of special plague saints,
such as St. Sebastian, St. Roch, and St. Antony.</p>

</div>

<p>And closely allied to this last,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>4. Intercession by these special plague saints, or by
other saints whose association with plague was more fortuitous
and less widely recognized: such were St. Quirinus,
St. Adrian, and St. Valentine.</p>

</div>

<p>Many of these forms have attached to them some appropriate
prayer or invocation. Sometimes the religious element
is supplemented by an exposition of hygienic precautions
or of remedial measures. Thus a devotional cut comes to
be blended with injunctions, usually in verse, as to how to
stave off pestilence by isolation, fumigation, washing, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
dietary; or how to cure it by such measures as bleeding, or
plasters to hasten maturation of the buboes.</p>

<p>In addition to these types, a non-pictorial type is met with,
nearly akin to the English Broadside, in which the religious
purpose has almost or wholly disappeared, and which sets
out in uncompromising prose directions of prophylactic or
therapeutic character.</p>

<p><i>Pestblätter</i> originated in more ways than one. In times
of pestilence pilgrimages were often made to the shrines
of special saints, and rough representations of these saints
were provided, as memorials of their pilgrimage to the devout.
Sometimes the object of homage was some sacred picture,
which would then be roughly reproduced as a memento. At
other times they seem to have been issued by religious communities
for purely devotional purposes. Those of secular
character were either printed by order of the municipalities,
or were the product of private medical enterprise. Original
<i>Pestblätter</i> are to be seen in the leading museums of most
European countries. A selection of these has been admirably
reproduced in a portfolio<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> by Heitz and Mündel of Strasbourg.</p>

<p>Plate XVII (1) is a woodcut, probably printed at Nuremberg
at the commencement of the fifteenth century. The
Almighty is depicted with the drawn sword of pestilence in
His hand, within what would seem from its colouring in the
original to be a representation of the rose-wreath, emblematic
of the Virgin Mary. In the centre are St. Sebastian with his
symbolic arrow, and an angel tending the plague sore of
St. Roch. Below is a prayer to these two saints.</p>

<p>Plate XVII (2) shows the Almighty above, with the shafts
of pestilence in His hands. The crowned Madonna shelters
beneath her robe her suppliants, among whom are dignitaries
of the Church. Below a group of saints are interceding with
the Virgin and Child and St. Anna. The whole is encircled
by the Virgin’s girdle wrought into a rose-wreath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>St. Anthony is a favourite figure of these <i>Pestblätter</i>. He is
more closely associated with plague and pestilence in Germany
than is the case in Italy. He is also patron-saint against
erysipelas, known as St. Anthony’s Fire, which often raged
in epidemics in pre-Listerian times. He is commonly represented
with the cross, on which he was crucified, with a crutch
symbolic of his great age and feebleness, and with an exorcising
bell. The passing bell was tolled originally not only
to ask for prayers for the soul of the departed, but also to
scare away evil spirits from it. The pig, that accompanies
St. Anthony, is the emblem of the Devil, whose temptings
he successfully repelled. Even in the absence of St.
Anthony himself, his cross in the form of the Greek T is
often introduced, sometimes with Christ nailed upon it.
From this association of St. Anthony with the cross, it
became customary to appeal to him, as to the crucifix,
in times of pestilence.</p>

<p>The association of SS. Quirinus, Adrian, and Valentine
of Rufach with plague is purely local and incidental.
St. Quirinus was primarily the patron-saint of the gouty,
and St. Valentine of the epileptic, so that the name <i>Veltins
Krankheit</i> was applied to epilepsy. St. Adrian held under
his special protection the Flemish brewers, and the more
creditable patronage of the plague-stricken was only a later
accretion.</p>

<p class="tb">A very large number of pictures are designed to commemorate
specific plagues, and were painted in fulfilment of
vows made to the Madonna and saints for deliverance from
plague. Many of these have already been considered in
connexion with the legends and cults of SS. Sebastian and
Roch, to whom they were dedicated. But in far the larger
proportion of these pictures the central figure is the Madonna
(see Plates XI and XII). Sometimes she is attended by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
SS. Sebastian and Roch, and by other saints as well. The
added saints are, as a rule, the special protectors of the city,
for which the thank-offering has been vowed. Sometimes
they are the patron saints of confraternities, for whom
they have been painted. Sometimes the special medical
saints, Cosmas and Damian, are appropriately added to
the pictures. Examples may be seen in almost any gallery
of Italian pictures. In the Brera, Cima de Conigliano
(<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1460-1518) has painted the Madonna and Child with
St. John the Baptist, St. Sebastian, the Magdalen and
St. Roch, the last-named showing an incised wound on the
inner side of the right thigh. The character of the picture
may be taken as conclusive evidence of its origin and
purpose.</p>

<p>Titian’s picture in the Vatican shows the Madonna and
Child in glory, and St. Sebastian, St. Nicholas, St. Catharine,
St. Peter, and St. Francis are the attendant saints. This
picture was painted by Titian after the cessation of a plague
epidemic at Venice for the Franciscan church of S. Nicolò
de Frari.</p>

<p>Correggio’s ‘Madonna di San Sebastiano’, in which she is
attended by SS. Sebastian and Roch, with S. Geminiano,
the patron saint of Modena, was painted in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1515 in
commemoration of a plague that devastated that city three
years previously.</p>

<p>Yet another by Guido Reni (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1574-1642), in the
Academy at Bologna, was painted at the instance of the
senate of Bologna, after the plague of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1630. It was
carried in solemn procession through the city to its consecration,
and from this circumstance has been called ‘Il Pallione
del Voto’. The rainbow beneath the Madonna’s feet, and
the olive branch in the hand of the infant Christ, each signify
the return of peace. The attendant saints are the special
protectors of Bologna, St. Petronius, St. Francis, St. Dominic,
St. Proculus, St. Florian, St. Ignatius and St. Francis Xavier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>Raphael’s ‘Madonna of Foligno’, in the Vatican, has been
accounted by some a plague picture on account of its
general character, and of the fireball descending on the
city of Foligno. Raphael, however, painted the picture in
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1512, the very year in which it is recorded that an aerolite
fell into Foligno: the picture probably commemorates
the escape of some individual or institution. There was
a disastrous plague in Foligno, but not till <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1523, and it
has been depicted in a hideous picture by Gaetano Gandolfi
of Bologna (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1734-1802), which is now in the Corsini
Palace at Rome.</p>

<p>Miraculous Madonnas abound in Italy, but are, as a rule,
of little artistic interest. A pleasing exception is the
‘Madonna and Child’ that hangs in the tribune of the
church of Carmine in Perugia. It was put up to commemorate
the deliverance of Perugia from plague at the prayer of the
Perugian Carmelites: at each recurrence of plague it was
the object of popular adoration. Formerly it was covered
with a gauze veil, which caught fire and was destroyed, but
the Madonna herself escaped any trace of injury.</p>

<p>The Madonna of Ara Coeli and the Madonna of S. Maria
Maggiore are both accredited deliverers from plague and
pestilence in Rome.</p>

<p>Florence, too, has her miraculous Madonna in the small
village of Impruneta. This dark panel, blackened and
perished with the lapse of years, was found, so the legend
goes, in the soil at Impruneta, uttering a cry as the workman’s
spade struck it. Seldom or never exposed to the
gaze of the devout, she has suffered the indignity of an
exposure at the hands of the omnipresent photographer.
In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1527 plague broke out in Florence in the early
summer. On June 2, an enormous festival was celebrated
in honour of the Virgin of the Annunciation, that she might
be persuaded to succour the Commonwealth in its troubles.
But in July and August the mortality rose to 150-200 a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
day, and in the autumn to twice these numbers, so that all
business was at a standstill, and the city seemed deserted.
Then the government determined to have recourse to the
Black Virgin of Impruneta, whom the Commonwealth of
Florence has invoked so often in various crises of its history.
Of her Segni<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> says: ‘To this mother of God our city has
never publicly applied in vain, in whatever extremity of
distress. It is no light or silly thing, which I am here
affirming: for in time of drought she ever sent rain: in
periods of flood, she has restored to us fine weather: from
pestilence she has removed the poison: and in every most
grievous ill she has found its appropriate remedy.’ So the
Black Virgin was brought from Impruneta, and the magistrates
of Florence, ‘barefooted and in mourning, received
her at the gate of the city, and carried her in solemn and very
sad procession to the Church of the Servites. Forty thousand
citizens had died in the month of November. But the
never-failing Virgin of Impruneta prevailed on this occasion
also. For with the coming of the cold weather, the sickness
began to abate. And thus the faith of the Florentines in
their charm was more than ever confirmed.’ The Black
Virgin still watches over Florence in time of drought.
Readers of <i>Romola</i> will recall that other stirring procession
of the Impruneta Virgin, in which Savonarola strode along
defiantly among his company of black and white Dominicans.</p>

<p>Throughout France and Italy numerous pictures may be
seen, recording the ministrations of local or locally venerated
saints in time of pestilence. Such is Tiepolo’s picture in
the cathedral at Este, showing St. Tecla liberating Este
from plague. Pictures such as this stand midway between
the group of votive pictures and the group of actual plague
scenes, of which Raphael (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1483-1520) is the earliest
exponent.</p>

<p>Raphael’s drawing of ‘Plague’,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> now in the Uffizi gallery
at Florence, has become much worn with time. The picture
is divided into two parts by a head of the god Terminus
mounted on a lofty pedestal. To the right it is night-time,
but the interior of a house of mourning is shown in vertical
section. In its courtyard is a young man, with a torch in
his right hand, counting the number of stricken animals,
while with his left he prevents one of the sheep from coming
near to those that are dead. An ewe lies dead with a young
lamb fastened to her dried-up udder. An ox lying down
surveys the scene sadly. Above this corpse-strewn court a
stream of light, penetrating into the interior of a room,
illumines the figures of two Sisters of Charity, as they
minister to the master of the house, who is dying: he is
stretched on his bed, lying in a dense shadow—the shadow
of impending death. He seems to turn away from them and
to reject their help.</p>

<p>In the other part of the picture it is day, and daylight
shows up everywhere scenes of suffering, death, and desolation.
In the foreground lies the body of a woman stretched
out in death, while her child struggles to reach her ice-cold
breast. The father bends down hastily to hold the child
away, and, as he does so, covers his nose and mouth with
his hand, to keep out the contagion of the pestilence. Behind
this group an older woman turns away in horror: before it,
an old man buries his face in his hands against the plinth of
the statue in an anguish of sorrow, while a young man makes
off in panic. In the background broken columns and the
dead body of a horse serve to intensify the desolation of
the scene.</p>

<p>Raphael’s rendering of the scene, for all the horror of
its details, serves rather to inspire pity than horror. He
holds the balance evenly between the horrible realities of
the plague and the redeeming spirituality of human nature.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
Compassion and suffering stand side by side. The ox pities
his kind passively, as the Sisters seek to minister actively
to their kind. In the features and attitude of the child
Raphael has depicted the devotion that does not die with
death. The deepest note of pathos is touched in the form
of the old man in the centre of the picture, whose grey hairs
are brought down in sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>It has been asserted that Raphael’s rendering of the dead
mother and the child was inspired by an actual record of
Ambroise Paré, but as Paré was only born three years before
Raphael died, the statement falls to the ground.</p>

<p>Raphael’s debt seems to go back as far as to Aristides of
Thebes, who flourished about 340 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> Pliny<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> mentions
a picture by him, which so impressed Alexander the Great,
at the sack of Thebes, that he took it for himself, and ordered
that it should be sent to Pella. According to Pliny, the
picture represented a wounded mother lying at the point of
death, and her infant child creeping to her breast. Fear is
written in the expression of her face, lest the child should
draw blood from her breast, now that her milk is dry.</p>

<p>Raphael’s drawing has been engraved by Marco Antonio
Raimondi under the name of ‘Il Morbetto’. In Delaborde’s
<i>Marc-Antoine Raimondi</i> it is reproduced under the name
‘La Peste de Phrygie’, because on the pedestal are inscribed
the words of Vergil:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Vergil, in this brief description of pestilence, aims at no
more than mere poetic effect. It is introduced only to fill
up the cup of trouble for the Trojan wanderers, and is compressed
into a few lines. The Trojan fleet had just made
the land: Aeneas had laid the foundations of a new town,
and Ilium was to live again in Pergamus. Then the plague
broke out.</p>

<p class="noindent">As it stands, this is an outline sketch of a famine pestilence,
which Raphael had no intention of depicting, when he
adopted the line. Surely Sisters of Charity would not figure
in a Phrygian plague, some thousand years before Christ!</p>

<p>Besides pictures, a few medals exist commemorative of
plagues prior to the sixteenth century: these were sometimes
struck as mediums of spiritual consolation. Frequent
devices on these were representations of Christ on the
Cross, or of a Serpent on a pole. The specimen figured
here (Plate I (4)) is a Wittenberg thaler of 1528. It shows
these two devices on the opposite faces of the medal, each
with a descriptive legend.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century had drawn to a close in Italy amid
a confusion of epidemics. Pintor, the personal physician
of Pope Alexander VI, has left a book in which he says that
the <i>morbus Gallicus</i> first appeared at Rome in March 1493
and had claimed numerous victims by the August following.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
Then, after an inundation of the Tiber in December 1495,
plague broke out fiercely in Rome. Pintor states that the
touch of certain precious stones was vaunted as a specific.
In 1493 plague was raging also at Genoa and Naples. At
the latter city the mortality amounted to 20,000 souls.
A Genoese chronicler, Seneraga, attributes the outbreak
at Genoa to pollution of the shore by the dead bodies of the
Jews, who had sought sanctuary there on their expulsion
from Spain in 1492, but had died of starvation on the
outskirts of the inhospitable city. Jewish writers asserted
that there was plague in Spain, and that it was carried by
the fugitives in their ships to Italy. Most of the expelled
Jews found shelter from the persecution of the Cross under
the protection of the Crescent, in Constantinople, Salonica,
the Levant, and Northern Africa. It was this far-reaching
epidemic that drove Charles VIII of France out of Florence,
Rome, and Naples in succession, almost as soon as his army
had entered them.</p>

</div>

<p>Throughout the sixteenth century plague epidemics follow
each other in almost unbroken succession throughout Central
Europe. In Rome alone, during this century, there were no
less than twelve severe outbreaks. The archives of the
Capitol and the registers of contemporary notaries<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> abound
in scattered information concerning these visitations. It
had become an established custom that at the first appearance
of an epidemic the Pope and his court should escape
from Rome to a place of safety, leaving the municipality
to provide for the situation as best it could. In May 1449,
Nicholas V had fled into Umbria: in 1462, Pius II had fled
successively to Viterbo, Bolsena, and Corsignano. In 1476,
Sixtus IV had flitted in like manner from place to place.
So in April 1522, at the height of the epidemic, it seemed
only in accordance with precedent, when Adrian VI from his
secure seclusion in Spain sent word to Rome of the necessity
of imposing a fresh tax for supporting a crusade against the
Turks. The Cardinals seem to have desired to emulate
the example of Adrian, for in June the Town Council asked
the Sacred College not to forsake their posts. Deserted by
their spiritual leaders, the populace lent a ready ear to the
imposture of the Greek necromancer Demetrius of Sparta.
He persuaded the terrified people that the plague was the
work of demons, and that, by appeasing them, it might be
brought to an end. So he paraded the streets of the city,
leading by a silken cord a bull that he professed to have
tamed by spells, and sacrificed it in the Colosseum with full
pagan ritual to the hostile demons. As soon as the clergy
realized the enormity of the sacrilege they had condoned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
they instituted a penitential procession, which marched
through the city, scourging themselves to bleeding and
crying <i>Misericordia</i>. If we may credit Paolo Giovio, chief
physician to Clement VII (<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1523-34), it was neither
prayer nor sacrifice that put an end to the plague, but
a wonderful oil invented by Gregorio Caravita, a physician
from Bologna. The Oratorio del Crocifisso, near the church
of S. Marcello, is said to have been erected in expiation of
this event. This plague lingered on at least till the following
year, <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1523, for Benvenuto Cellini<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> records his experience
of it in some detail. He says that it dragged on for months,
and that several thousands died daily in Rome. In not
unnatural apprehension on his own account, he determined
to adopt such amusements as would promote cheerfulness
of mind, which many believed to be the best remedy against
infection. So he betook himself to shooting pigeons among
the ancient monuments of Rome, and found the pursuit so
beneficial to his health that he succeeded in staving off
for a long time the plague, to which many of his comrades
succumbed. But somewhat later, after spending the night
with a young serving girl, he himself fell a victim and has
recorded his initial sensations as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘I rose upon the hour of breaking fast, and felt tired,
for I had travelled many miles that night, and was wanting
to take food, when a crushing headache seized me: several
boils appeared upon my left arm, together with a carbuncle
which showed itself just beyond the palm of the left hand,
where it joins the wrist. Everybody in the house was in
a panic: my friend, the cow [Faustina] and the calf [the
serving girl] all fled. Left alone there with my poor little
prentice, who refused to abandon me, I felt stifled at the
heart, and made up my mind for certain I was a dead man.’</p>

</div>

<p>By the constant ministrations of a male friend and the
help of a physician, whom the apprentice summoned,
Benvenuto threw off the sickness, but while the bubo was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
still open and plugged with lint under a covering of plaster,
went out riding on a little wild pony. Benvenuto’s account
is valuable as the record of the personal sensations and
sufferings of a plague-stricken man, and tells us also something
of the treatment to which he was subjected at the
hands of sixteenth-century medicine.</p>

<p>Benvenuto says that the joyous reunion of the survivors,
after the plague was over, led to the formation by one
Michael Agnolo, a sculptor, of a club of all the leading
painters, sculptors, and goldsmiths in Rome. The meetings
of the club, to judge from his descriptions, seem to have been
devoted to merrymaking rather than to artistic discourse.
On his return to Florence he found that his father and most
of his household were dead, and his surviving sister Liparata,
believing him to have died at Rome, swooned at sight of
him. But under the mellowing influence of supper, at which
weddings were the main topic of conversation, sorrow
speedily gave place to gaiety.</p>

<p>Marselius Galeati of Padua at the beginning of the
fifteenth century had drawn up the first known code of
‘Regulations against the Plague’, based on the belief that
the disease was imported to Italy by foreign commerce.</p>

<p>From the records of the city of Rome it is possible to gather
some idea of the measures adopted by the Popes and Town
Council for the suppression of epidemics of plague. There
isolation of infected individuals or districts was attempted.
All wearing apparel and other materials and articles capable
of spreading the infection, were liable to be destroyed.
The city gates were closed, and every incomer was subjected
to strict inspection, and was frequently rejected. Those
gates that were left open could only be used from daybreak
to nightfall, when they were locked against all comers.
Navigation of the Tiber was sometimes suppressed; Lanciani
says that an order was issued on July 30, 1575, that all the
boats on the Tiber should be scuttled in three days, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
it was found that the boatmen were ferrying passengers
across stream for bribes. Two transgressors were actually
put to the rack for their offence, which was placarded over
them for all to read. On one occasion a wholesale destruction
of dried fish was taken in hand. Contract medical practice
seems to have existed even in these days. Lanciani has
noted among the city records agreements between physicians
or quacks and Roman families for the provision of medical
advice and drugs for a stipulated payment of money. Wills
were often dictated from windows, while lawyer and
witnesses stood in the street beneath.</p>

<p>Confraternities for ministering to the sick and removing
them to the hospitals existed in Rome, though perhaps
numerically less than in other great cities of Italy. The
confraternity of the <i>Pietà</i> had been instituted during a plague
epidemic, in the time of Eugene IV (1431-47), and still
has a nominal existence in Rome.</p>

<p>Plague broke out fiercely again in Rome in 1527, at the
time of the sack of the city. Florence was also involved
in this same epidemic. It is this visitation that gave birth
to Machiavelli’s <i>Descrizione della Peste di Firenze dell’ anno
1527</i>, cast in the form of a letter to a friend. In it we
find no vivid picture of the awful catastrophe that was
overwhelming Florence, but in place of that a cold-blooded
cynical record of the trivial doings of a loafer sauntering
idly through the streets of the plague-stricken city. It is
a record that challenges comparison rather with the casual
entries of <i>Pepys’s Diary</i>, than with the formal descriptions
of Bocaccio and Manzoni, his own compatriots. Opening
with a vapid soulless lamentation, in the vein of Petrarch,
over the general demoralization and devastation produced
by the plague, he passes on to describe his own daily mode
of living, from which his correspondent is invited to infer
that of the general body of citizens. The <i>liaisons</i> of licentious
monks, the vile ribaldry of infamous buriers, the vain recourse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
to preservatives against the plague, these are the things that
are uppermost in his mind, as he depicts his own amorous
intrigues against the dark background of the plague, with
the fidelity of a Pepys and the light-hearted insouciance of
a Guy de Maupassant.</p>

<p>Villari, Macaulay, and others have declined to accept the
<i>Descrizione</i> as an authentic product of Machiavelli’s pen.
They cannot reconcile its garrulous obscenity with the
stern cold-blooded restraint of the author of the <i>Principe</i>—the
frivolity of the one with the sinewy manhood of the
other. They seem to forget that, so far back as 1502, amid
the stirring life of the camp of Caesar Borgia, he had found
leisure to write similar puerilities to his friends in Florence.
Political rectitude, or if we may not ascribe this to
Machiavelli, political sagacity is no guarantee of moral
righteousness, and sensuality is not the exclusive property of
the young. Moral levity, as the history of pestilence shows,
is a usual product of the constant imminence of danger and
death; and with Machiavelli political degradation had left
moral levity in sole possession of the field.</p>

<p>A copy of the discredited production still actually exists
in the handwriting of Machiavelli, with revisions inserted
in the manuscript in that of his friend Lorenzo di Filippo
Strozzi. Villari advances the strange suggestion, that Machiavelli
had merely copied out what Strozzi had composed.
Is it not equally reasonable to suppose that Machiavelli
had used an actual letter of Strozzi, as the basis of a casual
composition? This would explain the fact that it is cast
in epistolary form, as well as the apparent discrepancy of
style. Francesco Berni (<i>c.</i> 1490-1536), a contemporary
of Machiavelli, has apostrophized plague in one of his
satirical poems or <i>capitoli</i>. A cleric, to whom indolent
pleasure was the be-all and end-all of existence, he must
surely stand alone among writers as one who would hug the
pestilence to him as a friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘The pestilence time is good—a fig for other times....
Firstly, it carries off the rabble, it destroys them, makes
holes among them and thins them out—like a housewife
among the geese at Allhallowtide! In the churches there are
none to press upon you. Besides, none keep any record of
buying or borrowing. Yea, buy and make debts, for there
will be no creditors to trouble you. And if a creditor should
come, tell him that your head aches, that your arm pricks,
he straight will go away, and will not turn him round!
If you go out, no one will cross your path: rather is place
yielded to you, and honour done you, especially if you are
clothed in rags. You are lord of yourself and lord of others.
You can watch the folk’s strange antics and laugh at others’
fear. Life has then new laws: every pleasure is allowed....
Above all, there need be no work done. It is a choice life,
serene and large: time passes very gaily from dinner time
to supper.’<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1530 there was plague in Geneva,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> which is
memorable as the occasion of an accusation against certain
persons of disseminating the disease by means of concocted
poisons. In the spring of the year a dissolute young man, one
Michael Caddod, was seen to throw down a handkerchief
near a shop. Some one picked it up, and its foul smell
aroused suspicion. Caddod was forthwith put to torture,
and in his agony implicated Jean Placet, an unqualified
surgeon in charge of the pest-house, together with his wife,
son, and servant, and one Dom Jehan Dufour, priest and
confessor to the pest-house. Under the influence of torture,
they were driven to admit, that they had sworn solemnly
on a Book of Hours to join in spreading the plague, so as to
enable them to pillage the sick. Placet and his wife, they
said, had prepared the poison from poultices that had been
used on discharging buboes, by drying them to powder
and then adding veratrum. Caddod and his wife undertook
to spread it about the streets, while Placet and his wife
administered it to patients in the pest-house with promptly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
fatal results. Suspicion fell on Placet, and a barber-surgeon,
Bastian Granger, with his assistant, was instructed to keep
an eye on his doings. Madame Placet was equal to the
occasion and gave the pair short shrift with a dose of
poison in their food. In the end Placet and Caddod were
convicted. Their hands were first cut off in front of the
houses of their supposed victims. Next their flesh was cruelly
lacerated with red-hot pincers, and finally the headsman’s
axe put a merciful end to their sufferings. Young Placet’s
age obtained for him the lenient treatment of hanging, while
Dufour was first unfrocked and then hanged. A rapid
decline of the plague ensued on so acceptable a sacrifice.</p>

<p>A few years later, in January 1545, a recurrence of plague
in Geneva raised anew the phantom of another plague
plot. This time the bailiff ordered the arrest of the two men,
Bernard Dallinge and Jehan Lentille. They were alleged
to have cut off the foot of a corpse that had fallen from
the gallows, and used it as an ingredient of a plague ointment
that they smeared on the handles of doors. By March,
confessions extracted from them by torture had served to
implicate no less than forty persons. All were accused of
having sworn to spread the disease broadcast, and of having
actually smeared door-handles and locks. When searched,
boxes of ointment were found in their possession. The
craze for carrying antipestilential remedies made this an
easy matter, but for all that their guilt was manifest. Calvin,
in a letter of March 27, 1545, addressed to Myconius, seems
to credit their guilt, but the State records of Geneva show
that he mercifully advocated strangling instead of mutilation
and the stake. As in the case of Servetus, he
was less concerned about their deaths than the manner
of their dying. Nineteen men and seven women—Catholics
perhaps—profited by his clemency, and were
executed without preliminary torture. The <i>Nuremberg
Chronicle</i> says that in 1494 all the beggars were driven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
out of Nuremberg, because they were believed to spread
the plague.</p>

<p>The leaders of medicine were no more exempt than the
people from the promptings of fanatical fear. Ambroise
Paré<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> echoes the crude suspicions that Guy de Chauliac
had expressed at the time of the Black Death. This is his
advice to the magistrates in time of pestilence: ‘What shall
I add? They must keep an eye on certain thieves, murderers,
poisoners, worse than inhuman, who grease and smear the
walls and doors of rich houses with matter from buboes and
carbuncles and other excretions of the plague-stricken, so
as to infect the houses and thus be enabled to break into
them, pillage and strip them, and even strangle the poor
sick in their beds: which was done at Lyons in the year
1565. God! what punishment such fellows deserve: but
this I leave to the discretion of the magistrates, who have
charge of such duties.’</p>

<p>Paré recommended, as a prophylactic, the wearing of an
amulet of arsenic. It was to be worn over the heart in
order that ‘the heart might become accustomed to poison,
and so be the less injured when other poisons sought it’.</p>

<p>The pandemic of <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1565 was the occasion of a great
impetus to the production of the so-called Mystery and
Miracle plays, particularly in the south-east parts of France.
Mystery plays aimed for the most part at setting forth the
central mysteries of the New Testament, such as the Incarnation,
the Nativity, the Passion, and the Redemption. Miracle
plays dealt with the legends of the great saints of the Church,
but in practice the distinction of Miracle and Mystery came
to be ignored in the play. The purpose of each, in time of
plague, was to appease an angered God by glorifying His
majesty, either directly or through the medium of His saints.
The origin and prime purpose of these plays had almost
certainly been educational, for the instruction of a populace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
unable to read for themselves: and they originated out of
the worship of the Christian Church. Christianity, when
adopted as the State religion, had dealt the death-blow to
the vicious spectacles of the amphitheatre that were all
that survived of the ancient classical drama. Christianity
was also destined to become the parent of the modern drama,
by the introduction into public worship, not later than the
fifth century <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>, of living pictures to illustrate and expound
its teaching. Mystery and Miracle plays alike were evolved
from this simple liturgical origin. The transformation had
been effected at any rate as early as the twelfth century,
and by <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1380 a complete Miracle play was produced in
the presence of Charles IV.</p>

<p>Successive epidemics of plague had led to the adoption
of these plays as instruments of intercession, and the pandemic
of 1565 gave a great impetus to this development.
When the district of Maurienne was in the grip of the plague
in 1564, the people vowed to present in the following year
the Miracle play of their patron saint St. Martin, if only
their town were spared. No less than seventy-four actors,
all drawn from the working class, devoted themselves
to learning and rehearsing the various parts of the play.
Money as well as time was freely afforded, for the people
themselves undertook the expenses of staging, scenery, and
music. The marginal notes of the play, which has been
recently published, show that the stage was erected beside
the wall of a church. Later, as the control of the performances
passed out of the hands of the Church into those of lay associations,
the plays came to be performed away from the churches,
a separation that paved the way for the secularization of
the drama by the introduction of a non-religious atmosphere.
This play is in dialect and arranged for presentation on two
days. At the first performance the central theme was the
life of St. Martin as a soldier, at the second his life as a bishop,
and with it were shown certain of his miraculous cures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>This play is but one of many that have recently been
published: other towns followed the example of St. Martin
de la Porte. Villard-le-Lans vowed and played the ‘Mystery
of the Passion’ and the ‘Miracle of Saint Sebastian’:
Modane the ‘Mystery of the Last Judgement’: Termignan
and Sollières the ‘Miracle of Saint Laurence’, and so on.
Local authors, commonly the priest or the notary, compiled
the various plays.</p>

<p>At Villard-le-Lans is a chapel of St. Sebastian. It has no
windows, and a doorway hewn in the rock. It was prepared
as a theatre for presenting a Mystery play in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1446.
But following the plague of 1565 it was converted, in fulfilment
of a rich man’s vow, into a chapel adorned with frescoes
illustrating the story of St. Sebastian. The frescoes survive
to this day, and have been fully described by M. l’Archiviste
de Jussin.</p>

<p>If we may credit local legend, the Oberammergau Passion
Play had a similar origin in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1633. One Gaspard
Schueler, a native of Oberammergau, but living at Eschenlohe,
where plague was rife, determined to pay a hasty and
surreptitious visit to his wife and children. He did so, and
carried the plague to Oberammergau, where he died of it
himself. Between the day of his death and the festival of
SS. Simon and Jude, thirty-three days later, eighty-four
persons died of plague at Oberammergau. A meeting of
the inhabitants was summoned, and six women and twelve
men took a solemn vow to produce every ten years a play
representing the sufferings of Christ. They were rewarded
by the immediate cessation of the plague.</p>

</div>

<p>Throughout the fourteenth and two succeeding centuries
Venice was visited by a constant succession of epidemics of
plague. This was the price she was doomed to pay for the
enjoyment of her Oriental commerce. Standing, as she stood,
at the meeting-place of east and west, so long as the commerce
of the east passed to the west by way of Syria and
Egypt, Venice knew no rival but Genoa, until the Turk
appeared at Constantinople to challenge her ascendancy.
Plague and commerce alike passed through Venice on their
way to the countries of Central and Northern Europe.
Plague was in some sense the measure of Venetian opulence,
and with the loss of this opulence the number of her plagues
declined.</p>

<p>Venice had two main trade routes by sea,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> one to the east
and one to the west, and two land routes to the north.</p>

<p>The first maritime route lay down the Adriatic, past the
Ionian Isles, and round Cape Matapan to Crete, where it
divided into four branch routes: (<i>a</i>) northwards to the
Dardanelles, Constantinople, the Black Sea, and the Sea of
Azov; (<i>b</i>) along the shores of the Morea and through the
Aegean Islands to the Dardanelles; (<i>c</i>) to the ports of Asia
Minor, Smyrna, and Aleppo, Cyprus, Syria, Alexandretta,
and Beirut; (<i>d</i>) to Alexandria and Egypt. These two last
branches linked Venice to the caravan routes that led from
Ormuz on the Persian Gulf to Aleppo and Beirut, and from
Suez to Alexandria, and at their far end penetrated into
the heart of Asia, Persia, India, and Cathay.</p>

<p>The second maritime route lay by way of the Adriatic
westward to Sicily, where it divided into two branch routes:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
(<i>a</i>) to Tunis, Tripoli, and the ports of Spain; (<i>b</i>) through the
Straits of Gibraltar northwards as far as England and Flanders,
bringing London and Bruges into touch with the east.</p>

<p>The land routes from Venice to Central Europe lay for the
most part outside the confines of Venetian territory. One
passed by way of the Ampezzo valley northward to the
Pusterthal and on to Innsbruck and Munich; the other
along the Po to Brescia and Bergamo, and thence by Lake
Como and the Splügen Pass to Constance. From Constance
trade lines diverged to all parts of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>A knowledge of these routes is necessary to understand
the leading part that Venice and Constance played in the
carriage and distribution of plague.</p>

<p>The discovery of the Cape route to the east in 1486, was
the death-blow to the trade monopoly of Venice. The lines
of commerce shifted step by step from the Mediterranean
to the Atlantic, and away from the ships of Venice into those
of the Portuguese, Spaniards, English, and Dutch.</p>

<p>The history of plague in Venice is in large part written in
her public monuments: her archives tell the rest. Venice
has virtually no literature of her own: two or three patriotic
diarists, and that is all. Her Renaissance gave birth to no
harvest of men of letters: painting and architecture sapped
all her strength. Artists vied with architects to write her
history on canvas or on stone, not for the enjoyment of
private patrons, but for the embellishment of the city of
their birth.</p>

<p>In <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1410 plague swept over Venice and Chioggia. In
1423 another epidemic was imported from the east. It was
this visitation that led the Venetians to establish a pest-house
or lazaretto on the island of Santa Maria di Nazaret
for infected persons and goods. It was supplied with food,
medicine, and medical attendance out of the revenue from
salt. This was the first institution of the kind in Europe, but
it quickly led to the establishment of more elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>The Government of Venice was never wont to fold its
hands when plague was at its door. So far back as the
Black Death they had appointed three nobles as <i>provveditori
sopra la salute della terra</i> to fight the scourge. In 1468 these
were supplemented by the addition of two inhabitants of
each <i>sestiere</i>, and in 1485 this commission was reorganized as
a permanent Board of Health. So by the end of the fifteenth
century Venice had organized and equipped an efficient
defensive system against the constant recurrence of plague.</p>

<p>A second lazaretto was established during the plague of
1576 on the island of Sant’ Erasmo, and in the same year the
Republic summoned learned professors of medicine from
Padua—Girolamo Mercuriale and Giovanni Capodivacca—to
identify the disease, and it was no fault of the Republic
that they pronounced it not to be plague.</p>

<p>A curious evidence of the mutual influence of religion
and therapeutics on each other is the fixing of quarantine
at forty days, because this was the period that Christ dwelt
apart in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Venetian doctors for the most part seem now to have
mended their ways and devoted themselves loyally to the
service of the sick. In a book published in Venice in <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1493,
<i>Fasciculus medicus Johannis de Ketam</i>, the physician Pietro
da Fossignano is shown visiting a plague patient. As he
feels the pulse, he holds to his mouth and nostrils a sponge,
steeped in some antipestilential aromatic. Pietro’s death
about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1400 helps towards fixing the date of this simple
clinical precaution. In later years a special plague dress
was devised for doctors, which was adopted from Italy by
France, and of which several engravings exist of about the
time of the 1720 plague of Marseilles (see pp. 206-8).
Ambroise Paré recommends that the material should be
camlet, serge, satin, taffeta, or morocco, but not cloth, frieze,
or fur, which might harbour the poison and carry death to
the healthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>Venice had also her street ambulance in the brotherhood
of S. Rocco, instituted for the purpose of conveying the sick
to hospital and the dead to burial. Their services were sorely
taxed in times of plague. A specimen of the working dress
of the Order may still be seen in the Treasury of the Scuola
di San Rocco. It is a loose white cotton overall with full
hanging sleeves. On each side of the chest is an oval white
satin badge, embroidered with red silk and edged with red
lace. On one the figure of Christ is embroidered in silk: on
the other that of S. Rocco with his dog. It is bound at the
waist with a corded girdle of white cotton with heavily
ornamented cotton tassels at each end. A deep peaked
hood of the same material completely covers the head,
having only slits as apertures for the eyes. White leather
gloves complete the costume. A similar dress was worn by
many of the charitable confraternities of Central Italy, and
is to be seen in several Sienese pictures (see Plate VIII). It
has its modern counterpart in the operating dress of the
aseptic surgeon, but by a queer turn of the whirligig of time
its purpose is no longer to keep infection out, but to keep
it in.</p>

<p>The Guild of San Rocco had come into existence at least
as early as <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1415, but it was not till 1478 that leave was
obtained from the Government to enlist a confraternity
under the standard of San Rocco. Its first meeting-place
was the church of San Giuliano, but in 1485 the guild undertook
to build a church for the custody of the body of the
saint, which some Venetians had surreptitiously removed
from Montpellier. Five years sufficed to complete the
church, and the saint’s body was laid in it with great
solemnity. The precious relic was destined to bestow great
prestige on its possessors. Of the five great charitable guilds
of Venice, that of S. Rocco was by far the greatest. From
1516 to the end of the Republic each Doge was enrolled
a member, along with many of the richest merchants of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Venice. In this year the brethren determined to erect
a meeting house adjacent to the church, which should be
an added ornament to the city. So the building of the Scuola
was commenced in 1517 by Bartolommeo Bon, only to be
finished in 1550 by Antonio Scarpagnino.</p>

<p>While the Scuola was in course of construction, the
original church of S. Rocco was found to be insecure, and
was rebuilt, but not in its present form, which is no older
than 1725. In 1559 the Confraternity entrusted its decoration
to Tintoretto, and there are still to be seen there, on
the rare occasions when daylight suffices, the four pictures in
which the artist set himself to illustrate the life of the saint.
These are (1) St. Roch in hospital; (2) St. Roch healing
animals; (3) The capture of St. Roch; (4) The appearance
of an angel to St. Roch in prison. The small picture
that hangs by a side-altar—the ‘Betrayal of Christ’, by
Titian—has received all the homage that should have been
paid to Tintoretto’s subjects: indeed, the offerings rendered
to this ‘miraculous’ picture enabled the guild to rebuild their
Scuola. To this church the Doge came yearly on August 16
to implore St. Roch to ward off plague from the Republic.</p>

<p>In 1560 the growing wealth of the guild induced them to
call in competition the leading painters of Venice to decorate
the halls of the Scuola. Andrea Schiavone, Federigo Zuccaro,
Giuseppe Salviati, Paolo Veronese, and Tintoretto
were all invited to prepare drawings and submit them to
the judges on the appointed day. While the others had
merely sketched designs, Tintoretto had finished a complete
picture, ‘St. Roch in glory’, that now occupies the centre
of the ceiling of the refectory. To ensure still further his
success, Tintoretto presented the picture to the guild. From
this time until 1588 the decoration of the Scuola formed the
chief part of Tintoretto’s work. By the beginning of 1566
he had completed the superb ‘Crucifixion’ in the refectory
of the upper hall, and on its completion he was admitted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
to the Confraternity, and assigned an annual subsidy of
100 ducats (about £50) in payment for three finished pictures
each year. Here, at any rate, he found scope for the expression
of an inexhaustible fancy: but those who have
attempted to study the paintings of the Scuola will appreciate
something of the difficulties he had to surmount owing
to the defective light which, as in the church, renders the
pictures invisible except on the brightest days.</p>

<p>As Michelangelo had done in the Sistine Chapel, so
Tintoretto thought out in advance a comprehensive and
harmonious scheme for the entire adornment of the halls.
The key-note of it all is the dedication of the Scuola to
San Rocco, the patron saint of the plague-stricken, and also
of those who ministered to them. So the paintings in the
upper hall represent acts of mercy and deliverance, illustrated
in Christ’s life on earth. Those in the lower hall of
entrance, eight in number, setting forth mainly the history
of the Virgin and her infant Son, form thus an appropriate
prelude to the upper series. Giovanni Marchiori and his
pupils have faithfully pursued the scheme in the twenty
subjects from the life of St. Roch carved in the panelling of
the upper hall. The great staircase that joins the two halls
is decorated with frescoes of plague scenes by Zanchi (1666)
and Negri (1673), of little artistic merit. Yet another
memorial of plague survives in the rows of wooden standard
lamps, set round the upper hall, which the brethren used to
carry in processions to the honour of their patron saint.</p>

<p>Tintoretto was still at his work in the Scuola when the
appalling plague of 1575-7 fell on Venice, carrying Titian
to his grave, within close hail of his centenary. While others
were hurried away to obscure burial in the common plague
pits of Sant’ Erasmo and the outlying islands, the body of the
old man, who had brought so great glory to Venice, was
accorded the honour of a public funeral by order of the
Signoria. After lying in state it was carried to the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
Gothic church of S. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, wearing the
insignia of Imperial Knighthood, conferred on him by
Charles V, and placed in a tomb at the foot of the altar of
the Cross. Here Titian sleeps his last sleep unmindful, be it
hoped, of the outrage in marble inflicted on his memory by
Ferdinand I of Austria, at the hands of Luigi and Pietro
Zandomeneghi. Titian’s eldest son died with him, and his
second son, Pomponio, a canon of Milan, hastened to Venice,
as soon as he was assured that all danger was past, and
quickly dissipated the fortune that the painter had amassed
by the thrift and labour of a lifetime.</p>

<p>For three years this plague devastated Venice, carrying
off no less than 50,000 souls, one quarter of her whole
population. The Doge, Luigi Mocenigo, displayed throughout
the utmost courage and devotion. He himself superintended
all the efforts to arrest the plague, and ministered in
person to the sick. He went in solemn procession with all
the confraternities of Venice to the church of S. Rocco, to
vow the erection of another church, if only the saint would
intercede for them. As Cyprian and Gregory had done
before him, he addressed words of consolation and encouragement
to his people in the sanctuary of his cathedral church.
But Luigi was dead when the day came for his successor to
summon the people of Venice to St. Mark’s to fulfil Luigi’s vow.</p>

<p>Picture to yourself Venice one July Sunday under a
cloudless sky. From the pulpit of St. Mark’s some aged
patriarch has proclaimed the freedom of the city from plague.
Out of the coloured gloom of the church files the procession
into the dazzling glare of the Piazza. All Venice is there:
Venice is in jubilant mood. St. Mark’s, Ducal Palace,
Campanile, and all the buildings around are gay with
carpets and tapestries, with pictures and gilded shields.
Banners of gorgeous colours flutter to the crisp sea-breeze
from the columns of Theodore and the Lion. Amid wild
shouting of people and roar of cannon, and ringing of bells<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
the procession wheels to the Piazzetta. Before it lies the
lagoon, stretching over to S. Giorgio Maggiore, and away to
the Lido beyond, sparkling and shimmering in the sunlight,
like some great scintillating jewel. God and man seem to
have joined hands there to create the fairest spot of earth.
From Piazzetta to Giudecca a bridge of boats has been
thrown over, near half a mile in length. On to the bridge
goes the procession.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The guilds and confraternities, displaying
their respective standards and carrying crosses, images
of the Madonna and saints, and reliquaries, lead the way,
followed by magistrates, nobles, and their ladies. Next
come the patriarchs, the Church dignitaries, and canons in
their rochets, the friars, chanting, under the banners of their
fourteen orders, the clergy robed in rich copes embroidered
with gold and sewn with jewels, under their eleven banners.
Last of all, accompanied by senators and ambassadors, comes
the Doge, Sebastiano Venier, hero of Lepanto, a noble figure,
robed in white with a splendid mantle of silver brocade
hanging from his shoulders. In a temporary wooden oratory
built close to the place where the Redentore Church was to
rise from the plans of Palladio, Mass was sung this day to
music by Giuseppe Zarlino of Chioggia, the Doge’s chief
musician. And the sound of this jubilant day has echoed
down the ages and may be still heard at the yearly <i>Festa del
Redentore</i> in July, as the procession passes over its bridges
of boats from San Zobenigo to Zattere, and Zattere to
Giudecca, but shorn of much of its former glory. Where
stood the wooden chauntry stands now Palladio’s church,
a plague-spot on the face of nature. Théophile Gautier,
nevertheless, saw beauty in its aspect by the light of the
setting sun. Within there are no pictures and no memorials
of the plague to which it owes its being. A Venetian medal,
showing the Doge with the banner of St. Mark kneeling
before Christ, commemorates this plague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>Venice has other churches to commemorate her plagues
besides San Rocco and the Redentore; oldest of all,
S. Giobbe, church and convent, built in the middle of the
fifteenth century (1462-71) by Doge Cristoforo Moro, the
friend of S. Bernardino, and dedicated to the Job of Scripture
who was plagued with all manner of diseases. Over the high
altar was once the famous picture by Giovanni Bellini, now
in the Accademia, of the Madonna and Child enthroned
between St. Job, St. John Baptist, St. Sebastian, St. Francis,
and St. Louis of Toulouse. Venice brought the cult of
S. Giobbe along with plague from the east: he is hardly
known elsewhere in Italy.</p>

<p>Only a few years later (1506-18) another plague church,
that of S. Sebastiano, was built for the Order of St. Jerome
by the two architects, F. da Castiglione and A. Scarpagnino.
It is the burial-place of Veronese, to whom most of its
decoration is due. The ceilings of both church and sacristy
are enriched with his pictures, set in deep gilded mouldings.
Over the high altar is an ‘Apotheosis of St. Sebastian’, to
whom the Madonna appears in heaven, along with St. Mark,
St. Jerome, St. John Baptist, and St. Catharine of Alexandria.
To the left of the altar is Veronese’s famous
‘Martyrdom of Marcus and Marcellinus’.</p>

<p>While this church was building Giorgione died of plague.
About his four and thirtieth year he had become wildly
enamoured of a young woman, and when the plague seized
her he still paid her secret visits, and taking the sickness
from her lips with her kisses, he paid for his love with his life.</p>

<p>Last, but best known of all, is the church of S. Maria della
Salute, begun by Baldassare Longhena in 1632, to commemorate
the plague of 1630-1, which carried off 46,490
in Venice, and 94,235 in the whole lagoons. Doge Niccolò
Contarini had vowed a church to the Madonna of Health, if
she would deliver the Republic from the plague. During its
building a temporary wooden oratory was built on a piece<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
of land, which the Knights Templar had bestowed on the
Republic, and Doge, Council, nobles, and people crossed over
the Grand Canal by a bridge of boats to hear a solemn Mass.
In the sacristy of Longhena’s church are two seventeenth-century
prints, one showing the procession as it crosses the
pontoon bridge, the other, as it files up into the church. Each
year in November the procession starts from St. Mark’s and
crosses the Grand Canal by the Redentore route, and circles
round the church to the entrance facing the Canal. Modern
Venice has transformed a solemn pageant into a fancy fair.
These prints show the church as it now stands, on a platform
at the top of a great flight of stairs leading up from the Grand
Canal, but a statue of the Madonna has replaced the Angel
of Pestilence on the summit of its larger dome.</p>

<p>S. Maria della Salute contains many memorials of plague.
Over the high altar is a heavy group of marble statuary by
Giusto il Corto. In the centre sits the Madonna holding her
Child, with cherubs at her feet. On one side kneels a woman
entreating her aid: on the other a cherub with flaming
torch expels a plague demon of human form.</p>

<p>In the vault of the choir is a ceiling painting by Fiammingo
showing Venice imploring liberation from plague.</p>

<p>In the sacristy is Titian’s picture of St. Mark with St. Sebastian,
St. Roch, Cosmas, and St. Damian, commemorating the
plague of 1512, in which Giorgione perished (see Plate IX).
Here, too, is Marco Basaiti’s (second half of fifteenth
century) votive picture of St. Sebastian, a fine figure in
a beautiful Umbrian landscape, but not the peer of Sodoma’s
saint: and yet another picture of St. Roch, St. Sebastian,
and St. Jerome by Girolamo da Treviso (1497-1544).</p>

<p>Milan had suffered from the Black Death far less than
other cities of Italy: maybe she had acquired a transient
immunity. For the three succeeding centuries her history is
one long catalogue of plagues, of which two claim special
notice.</p>

<p>In 1576 plague broke out in late July. Carlo Borromeo
was archbishop at the time. The son of Ghiberto Borromeo,
Count of Arona, and Mary de Medici, Carlo was of noble
parentage. His influence gained for him in early life the
archbishopric of Milan. Amid all his wealth his own personal
life was ordered with temperance and humility. Stern, or
as some say cruel, to track out and repress all the abuses that
had invaded the Church in his diocese, he earned the jealous
dislike of his clergy and of the religious orders. The Brothers
of Humility made open attempt on his life, but by a miracle
he escaped them. Carlo was away at Lodi when news reached
him that plague had broken out in Milan. Hastening back
to the city he found that the governor, many officials, and
all the rich had fled. All was in chaos. The people turned in
despair to their spiritual father, and entrusted the care of the
town to him. He set them to work at once to adapt the
great hospital of St. Gregory for the reception of the sick,
and later to build six lazarettos of wood outside the walls. All
these he equipped and furnished with linen from his own
palace. For its better administration he divided the city
into four quarters, and put over each an overseer with a staff
of helpers. His example of courage and personal devotion
served to attract many of the secular clergy, monks, and
nuns to the service of the sick. Even lay men and women
organized a nursing guild among themselves. Carlo himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
went everywhere, giving directions for housing the sick and
burying the dead. He visited even those parishes beyond
the walls, where the disease was raging, providing for the
sick, feeding the needy, and rousing the clergy to the loyal
discharge of their duty. Famine soon came to add another
horror to pestilence. Borromeo collected all the destitute
into an encampment and arranged the supply of food. First
he had all his own silver plate melted down to provide the
necessary money. When this ran out, he begged it from
door to door, and finally incurred huge debts on his own
personal security. Beyond such material aids as these,
Carlo Borromeo brought to the stricken Milanese the spiritual
comforts of religion. From the pulpit of his cathedral he
expounded to them the Lamentations of Jeremiah, showing
them how they applied to Milan. From the altar steps he
chanted with quivering voice the penitential psalms, and
kneeling before the altar offered himself to God as a sacrifice
for his people. Through the streets of the city he marched
at the head of penitential processions with bare feet and the
rope of the criminal around his neck. But through it all he
passed unscathed, himself and his eight-and-twenty attendant
priests. Only 17,000 died in Milan, and 8,000 in the
districts round about: that so few died out of so vast a
multitude of sick was attributed to the ministrations of their
archbishop.</p>

<p>As the traveller comes down from the Alps, skirting the
shores of Lago Maggiore, where gardens are radiant in spring
with camellias, magnolias, mimosa, and myrtle, one feature
only blurs the faultless landscape. On a ridge, high over
the lake at Arona, towers on its pedestal the statue of Carlo
Borromeo, a senseless, soulless colossus, in copper and
bronze, mocking the skies. Your guide-book tells you
you may go up inside its body. If you do so on a hot day
you may learn something of the sufferings of Phalaris,
roasted in the belly of his own brazen bull. But perhaps you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
will do as well to stay beneath and pray that something
rather of the spirit of Borromeo may enter into your soul.</p>

<p>Religion has canonized S. Carlo Borromeo; Art has
ensured him immortality. In the churches and galleries of
Milan he figures as patron saint against plague, sometimes
alone, sometimes conjointly with St. Roch. In Venice he
gives place to St. Roch, in Florence to St. Sebastian. In
parts of Central Italy S. Carlo reappears, attended often by
local saints, interceding with the Madonna. In the church
of S. Dominico in Perugia a picture shows him along with
S. Catharine of Siena, supplicating the Virgin. At S. Carlo
in Corso at Rome, along with S. Ambrose, he intercedes with
Christ, and another picture in the same church represents
his apotheosis.</p>

<p>Memorials of Borromeo are innumerable. The sacristy
of Milan Cathedral contains a life-size effigy in mitre and
robes, all in wrought silver: also a gilded wooden cross, on
which the various emblems of the Passion are carved in relief,
which he carried in plague processions: also a silk embroidered
portrait of him in his mitre. S. Carlo Catinari
at Rome has one of his mitres, and part of the rope that he
wore as a halter.</p>

<p>Beneath the floor of Milan Cathedral, below the dome and
in front of the choir, is the Cappella of Carlo Borromeo. His
remains lie in a silver coffin, supported on a silver altar, each
elaborately engraved and embossed. The hexagonal chamber
has the whole surface of its walls coated with plates of silver,
on which are reliefs representing a series of scenes from his
life. In one he is giving alms to the plague-stricken: in
a second he is baptizing children in a plague hospital: in
a third he is walking with feet and head bare, and with a halter
round his neck, in a plague procession, preceding the sacred
relics that are carried beneath a canopy.</p>

<p>Portraits of S. Carlo in Milan, those in the Cathedral, in
the Borromeo Palace and elsewhere, all in profile, show the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
prominent nose and receding forehead and a degree of
ugliness that would almost seem to forbid enrolment in the
catalogue of the saints. A rugged full-faced portrait by
Annibale Carracci (1560-1609), now in the Hermitage at
St. Petersburg, seems less discordant with the halo.</p>

<p>Pietro da Cortona (1596-1669) painted a picture of
Borromeo heading a plague procession, which is one of the
best of its kind. It is now over the altar of S. Carlo Catinari
at Rome, but hidden from view by a brazen symbol of rays
of glory.</p>

<p>The familiar theme of innumerable pictures both in Italy
and France is Carlo Borromeo carrying the Sacrament to the
plague-stricken. Some of the best known are those by Jakob
van Oost (le Vieux) (1600-71) in the Louvre: by Lemonnier
in the Musée at Rouen: by Cigoli (1559-1613) in the
church of Santa Maria Nuova at Cortona: by Francesco
Gossi in the church of Poveri at Bologna: and by Baldassare
Franceschini in the church of the Barnabites at Pescia.</p>

<p>The Flemish painter Gaspard de Crayer (1585-1669) has
varied somewhat the hackneyed features of the subject. In
his picture, Carlo Borromeo, in red episcopal robes, followed
by two acolytes carrying the taper and cross, bends down
and offers the Sacrament to a dying man, who kneels before
him with head bandaged and shirt thrown open over his
bare chest. Behind the man are two women, one of whom
supports his body, while the other in the shadow of a doorway
carries a glass of water in her hand. Kneeling beside
the man, with hands joined in prayer, a little boy awaits the
Sacrament: in the foreground lies a dead child. Before this
little corpse a man is seated on the ground, supporting his
head, his legs bare and covered with ulcers. Behind him are
two women, one of whom covers her mouth with a handkerchief,
while the other stretches out her hands to an
attendant deacon, who is distributing alms. The background
is a street of Milan with a vista of open country beyond.</p>

<p>Puget (1622-94) has represented the same subject in
a marble bas-relief, now in the Santé at Marseilles. Borromeo
kneels in earnest supplication amid a group of dead
and dying. His eyes are fixed on a cross borne aloft by
cherubs. He is attended by acolytes, who carry a cross and
chalice, and a child clings to his robes. In the foreground
a convict drags off a corpse for burial. In the background
a woman bends in wild despair over a bed, on which a dead
man is stretched.</p>

<p class="tb">In 1630 occurred the Great Plague of Milan, well known
to many by the description of Manzoni (1785-1873) in his
<i>Promessi Sposi</i>. For his information he has drawn on many
sources, and not least on the contemporary record of Canon
Ripamonti, written by request of the Magistracy as a supplement
to his History of Milan.</p>

<p>This volume on the plague bears an emblematic engraving
on the title-page. A skeleton holds in his hands weapons,
armour, bones, and books all strung together. The toes of
his feet protrude from beneath a carpet on which lies
a plague-stricken man. In front of the skeleton is an altar,
on which stand taper and crucifix. Beside the altar sits
a woman, a drawn sword in her right hand, her left arm
embracing a stork: a naked child is by her side. On the
frontal of the altar is the title of the book: ‘Josephi
Ripamontii, Canonici Scalensis Chronistae Urbis Mediolani,
De Peste Quae Fuit Anno cIↄIↄcxxx Libri v, Desumpti
Ex Annalibus Urbis Quos LX Decurionum Autoritate
Scribebat.’</p>

<p>In his <i>Storia della Colonna Infame</i>, published in 1840,
Manzoni has told the trial and punishment of the two
<i>Untori</i>, accused of spreading the plague by means of ointments.
The home of one of them was destroyed by order
of the State, and the ground on which it stood declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
accursed. On it a stone column was erected in 1630, bearing
the following inscription:<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Here, where this plot of ground extends, formerly stood
the shop of the barber, Giangiacomo Mora, who had conspired
with Guglielmo Piazza, Commissary of the Public Health,
and with others, while a frightful plague exercised its
ravages, by means of deadly ointments spread on all sides,
to hurl many citizens to a cruel death. For this, the Senate,
having declared them both to be enemies of their country,
decreed that, placed on an elevated car, their flesh should be
torn with red-hot pincers, their right hands be cut off, and
their bones be broken: that they should be extended on the
wheel, and at the end of six hours be put to death and burnt.
Then, and that there might remain no trace of these guilty
men, their possessions should be sold at public sale, and
their ashes be thrown into the river; and to perpetuate the
memory of their deed the Senate wills, that the house in
which the crime was projected shall be razed to the ground,
shall never be rebuilt, and that in its place a column shall be
erected, which shall be called Infamous. Keep afar off,
then, afar off, good citizens, lest this accursed ground should
pollute you with its infamy. August 1630.’</p>

</div>

<p>This cursing of the site recalls the curse of Joshua<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> on the
site of Jericho after its capture: ‘Cursed be the man before
the Lord, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho:
he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in
his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.’ And the
Constitutions of Moses<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> pronounced a similar curse on cities
that turned aside from the true religion.</p>

<p>In 1777 Count Pietro Verri, Counsellor of State in the
service of Maria Theresa, published a treatise on Torture,
in which special reference was made to this case at Milan in
1630. His work, however, did not see the light till 1804.
Then in 1839 the <i>Processo originate degli Untori nella peste
del 1630</i> was issued in Milan, giving a full official account of
the trial of these Anointers. Fletcher, in 1895, drew up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
a summary of evidence from all the sources in his <i>Tragedy
of the Great Plague of Milan</i>.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of June 21, 1630, one Catarina Rosa,
a woman of the lower classes, saw from the balcony of her
house a man going down the street writing on a sheet of
paper. He stopped to wipe his fingers on the wall of a house,
probably to get rid of ink-stains, but the woman’s fear at
once conjured up the superstitious image of a deadly ointment
smeared on the walls to spread the plague. A crowd
of excited women flocked to the Council Chamber to inform
the Senate, who at once ordered the man’s arrest. Henceforth
no one dared touch a wall. Ripamonti tells how three
young French travellers fared, who in admiring the marble
of a temple unsuspectingly ventured to touch it. Someone
saw them do it, and raised the alarm. Forthwith they were
savagely set upon and hurled into gaol, and only released
when it was found that there was no vestige of evidence to
suggest anything but innocent curiosity.</p>

<p>Again, an old man of eighty was seen to dust a bench in
the church of St. Anthony with his cloak before sitting
down. Immediately the women cried out that he was
anointing the benches, and the worshippers set on him there
and then in the church, and after beating him brutally
dragged him before the magistrates. Ripamonti believes
that he died of his injuries.</p>

<p>The search for the suspected Anointer resulted in the
arrest of one Guglielmo Piazza, a scrivener who carried an
ink-horn at his belt. He was also a commissioner of health,
that is to say, a petty official employed to report cases
of plague. Throughout two applications of torture he
stoutly denied the offence, but in his cell, broken with
suffering and fearing a renewal of torture, he yielded to the
suggestions of those around him. He confessed his guilt,
and declared that he obtained the deadly ointment from the
barber Giangiacomo Mora. This man was straightway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
arrested and carried to the court, but there vehemently
asserted his innocence and vowed that he had never seen
Piazza. Under torture, however, he gave way, and vied
with the unhappy Mora in concocting falsehoods. Among
others, they implicated Count Padilla, son of the Commandant
of the Castle, but in the end he was acquitted, and
it is from the notes of his trial that Verri obtained the
material for the narrative of Piazza and Mora.</p>

<p>Mora, like most barbers of his day, dabbled in medicine,
so that medicinal jars and vessels were found in his shop.
These, he asserted, contained preservatives against the
plague, and probably with truth, for during epidemics of
plague they were in great demand. Ambroise Paré gives an
elaborate formula for a preservative water, with which to
wash the body frequently and rinse the mouth, and a few
drops of it were to be placed as well in the nostrils and ears.
Similar nostrums were in great demand during the Great
Plague of London and that of Marseilles in 1720.</p>

<p>Piazza had occasionally visited Mora’s shop as a customer
of the barber, and both stated that Mora had undertaken
to prepare a pot of his preservative for Piazza. On this
innocent transaction was to be built up a charge of wholesale
murder. Mora was induced by torture to admit that Piazza
had supplied him with foam from the mouths of plague
victims to mix with his ointment.</p>

<p>In the intervals of torture Mora and Piazza more than
once recanted and declared that their confessions were false,
but a renewal of torture soon induced them to retract. The
ignorant ferocity of the populace called aloud for satisfaction.
At the conclusion of their examination the unhappy victims
were carried off for the execution of a terrible sentence, in
spite of the pledge of impunity. With the merciful prospect
of death before them, they openly asserted that all their
admissions incriminating others were false and had been
extracted from them by their terror of further torture.</p>

<p>At the end of the <i>Processo originale degl’ Untori</i> is a folded
plate representing in all its details the execution of Piazza
and Mora. It is a rough reproduction of an older undated
engraving, which Fletcher has reproduced from a copy in
the collection of medical prints and engravings in the library
of the Surgeon-General’s Office at Washington. The
engraver of this was Orazio Colombo, and it was published
in Rome by the authority of the Nuncio of the Roman
College.</p>

<p>On the top of the engraving is its title, which may be
translated, ‘The sentence pronounced on those, who had
poisoned many persons in Milan in the year 1630.’ Fletcher
appends this further description: ‘This is followed by
the names of the Magnificos, who sat in judgement, and
the particulars of the punishment decreed. Each scene in the
picture has its letter, which is referred to in an explanatory
legend below. The entire disregard of the unities of time
and place, which characterized such productions, is well
displayed in this curious engraving. On the right is the shop
of the barber Mora, and in front of it the “Column of Infamy”
is already erected. A large platform car, drawn by two
oxen, exhibits the victims, executioners, and priests. A
brazier of live charcoal contains the pincers with which the
flesh was to be torn. The barber’s right hand is on the block,
and a chopper held over the wrist is about to be struck down
by a mallet held aloft by the executioner. Further on is
seen a large platform, on which the two victims are having
their limbs broken by an iron bar, preparatory to their
exposure on the wheel for six hours. The wheels are also
displayed, one of them already on a pole, with the men
bound upon them. Still further on are the fires consuming
the bodies, and, last scene of all, on the extreme left is
a fussy little stream, foaming under bridges, which is
supposed to be a river, and into it a man is throwing the
ashes of the two malefactors.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>One dark night in 1788 Nature for very shame let loose
a storm that wrecked the Column: her minion Man then
tardily demolished the monument of his own infamy. The
balcony of Catarina Rosa’s house was also taken down, so
that no structure stands to call to mind the hideous tragedy.
The corner-house of the Vedra de’ Cittadini, on the left hand
as one comes from the Corso di Porta Ticinese, occupies the
site of poor Mora’s house. A dwelling has rested on the
accursed site since 1803.</p>

<p>It is surprising to find that not only does not Ripamonti
deny the guilt of the victims, but now and again he seems
to hint at its reality. It has to be borne in mind that in his
position as official historiographer of Milan it was hardly
permissible for him to express sentiments opposed to popular
conviction and the decisions of the courts of justice. As late
as 1832, during an epidemic of cholera in St. Petersburg, the
most circumstantial statements of miscreants putting poison
in the food and drink of the people were in every mouth.</p>

<p>Manzoni’s <i>Colonna Infame</i> is a simple unadorned narrative
of the trial and execution of the two Anointers, quite
different in literary form from his <i>Promessi Sposi</i>. It is
written with a definite purpose in view. Verri had introduced
the story into his <i>Observations on Torture</i>, merely as
an illustration of the way in which the confession of a crime,
both physically and morally impossible, may be extracted by
torture. Manzoni retells the tale, in the interest of humanity
at large, to show that no matter how deep may have been
the belief in the efficacy of ointments, and despite the
existence of a legislature that countenanced and approved
torture, it was competent to the judges to convict them,
only by recourse to artifices and expedients, of the injustice
of which they were perfectly well aware.</p>

<p>Manzoni’s <i>Promessi Sposi</i> is a happy blend of antiquarian
research and imaginative description, and the incidents of
the plague are dexterously woven into the fabric of his story.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Manzoni wrote at a time when literature, freed from the trammels
of convention, was being slowly brought into harmony
with the outlook of modern thought. Though an aristocrat
by birth, his upbringing had taught him to regard life with
the eyes of the peasant, and not with those of his overlord.
In his genius for romance and in his reverence for the past
Manzoni has much in common with Scott, but with this
difference, that Scott sees the social fabric from above,
Manzoni from below. To Scott life was a pageant in which
knights of chivalry and courtly dames shared all the leading
parts: Manzoni’s stage is filled with men struggling to be
rid of the yoke of feudal oppression. The plague of Milan,
falling alike on rich and poor, afforded him the text from
which to preach the essential equality of all men. His whole
narrative is so moulded as to throw into striking contrast
the vices of the rich with the virtues of the poor. The
plague scenes, too, give him scope for his remarkable
insight into the psychology of crowds, and for his skill in
marshalling men in masses, a gift in which he rivals Tintoretto.
It is the genius of Manzoni that he persuades without
preaching.</p>

<p>The total mortality of this pestilence in Milan has been
estimated roughly at 150,000 persons. The Sanità, or Board
of Health, profiting by the lessons of the previous plague,
seem to have acted with sense and energy, though hampered
by the ignorant obstinacy of the Senate, the Council of
Decurions, and the Magistrates, who were afraid of driving
away trade, if the presence of plague were admitted. One
strange remedial measure was the organization of an
immense procession through the streets in honour of San
Carlo. During the procession all the sequestered houses
were fastened up with nails to prevent the infected inmates
from joining in it. Deaths were so numerous at the
height of the plague that the burial-pits were filled, and
bodies lay putrefying in the houses and streets. The Sanità<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
sought the help of two priests, who undertook to dispose
of all the corpses in four days. With the assistance of
peasants, whom they summoned from the country in the
name of religion, three immense pits were dug. The Sanità
employed <i>monatti</i> to bring out the dead and cart them to the
pits, and the priests accomplished their task within the
appointed time. Besides the <i>monatti</i> they appointed
<i>apparitores</i>, or summoners, who went in advance of the
<i>monatti</i> ringing a bell to warn the people to bring out their
dead. <i>Commissari</i> supervised both <i>apparitores</i> and <i>monatti</i>.
Piazza was one of these overseers.</p>

<p class="tb">The plagues of the seventeenth century have left behind
them very many memorials both in literature and in art:
among them the great plague of Milan is only one of many.</p>

<p>Southern France was attacked again and again, and in
1643 plague raged fiercely at Lyons. Over the portico of the
church of Notre-Dame de Fourvière, which stands high up
on the precipitous hill that overhangs the town, is a frieze
commemorating this plague.</p>

<p>In Italy, city after city succumbed. Guido’s picture,
‘Il Pallione del Voto,’ reminds us that Bologna suffered
along with Milan. Venice suffered too, and out of her ruin
rose the church of S. Maria della Salute.</p>

<p>Florence retains in the Bargello a hideous reminiscence
of her visitation in a wax representation of ‘Pestilenza’
by Zumbo Gaetano Giulio (1656-1701). Corpses are lying
about in various stages of decomposition: among them lies
a dead mother beside her infant child. A man, whose
nostrils are covered with a bandage, attempts to carry away
a corpse. In the background great bonfires are burning.
The modelling of the carcases is anatomically exact, but the
production as a whole is utterly repulsive.</p>

<p>In 1656 Naples assumes the leading rôle in this hideous
Dance of Death. Soldiers brought the plague on a transport<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
from Sardinia. At first the viceroy attempted to disguise
the true character of the disease. The first doctor who dared
to pronounce the sickness plague was promptly put in
prison. Malcontents spread the report that the Spaniards
had designedly introduced the plague, and were employing
people to go through the city in disguise, sowing broadcast
poisoned dust. The infuriated populace turned on the
Spanish soldiery, who sought safety by transferring the
accusation to the French. Nothing but blood would satisfy
the mob, and Angelucci di Tivoli, reputed author of the
plague powder, was broken on the wheel as a peace-offering
to their bloodthirsty fury. The Spaniards were accused also
of poisoning the holy water in the churches by means of the
deadly powder. Superstition was rampant in every form.
One said that he had been miraculously cured by drinking
holy water before an image of the Virgin. Another saw
a marble statue of the Madonna and Child in the church of
S. Severo covered with sweat, and the faces of both livid and
marked by the plague. A doctor, Francesco Mosca, who
printed a formula for curing the plague, was honourably
entitled <i>Protomedico</i>. A nun prophesied that the building
of a convent on the hill of St. Martin for her sisterhood would
bring to an end the pestilence. The building was taken in
hand in eager haste, rich and poor vying in bodily labour,
but in spite of all their efforts the mortality grew apace. By
a strange perversity of reasoning penitential processions
paraded both day and night the very streets in which
priests, in terror of the contagion, were administering the
Sacrament on the end of a stick. The death-roll of six months
was 400,000 lives. Various writers have described this
plague, among them Muratori, Giannone, and de Renzi in
his <i>Naples in the year 1656</i>, published in 1667. The Papal
Nuncio in Naples at the time thought fit to write a pamphlet
on it, and of modern writers Shorthouse has made poor use
of it in his <i>John Inglesant</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Micco Spadara (1612-79), who actually witnessed this
plague, has left a picture of it, which is now in the National
Museum at Naples. It represents the Piazza Mercatello,
a veritable pandemonium of dead and dying. <i>Monatti</i>,
drawn from the galley-slaves, are dragging the corpses with
hooks to carts in which to carry them to the burial-pits.
Here and there sedan chairs are seen. These were used to
carry the sick to the lazarettos. At first chair-bearers were
selected from the citizens who volunteered for the task, but
when all these were dead, galley-slaves and convicts took
their place. In the plague of Marseilles in 1720 sedans were
put at the disposal of the doctors, ‘for their more easy
conveyance everywhere’, by order of the Town Council.</p>

<p>There was plague in Rome as well as Naples in 1656.
Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) was resident in Rome, and
has left the testimony of an eyewitness in his picture, ‘The
Plague of Rome,’ now in the Czernin Collection at Vienna.
It is a landscape with architectural features, of which Denio<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
gives this brief notice: ‘Two men are seen dragging a corpse
to the mouth of a vault, whose opening is already barred by
dead bodies. A man, enveloped in a white mantle, directs
the bearers where to go: by his side is a jackal-like dog.
On the high platform of the receptacle we notice a group of
six men. Broken columns take the place of the half-seen
trees in other works, while sarcophagi and tombs indicate
a cemetery. Beyond the arch stretches the Campagna.’
Poussin has introduced into the picture the Castle of
S. Angelo, mindful, no doubt, of the legend of Gregory’s
vision.</p>

<p>The church of Santa Maria in Campitelli at Rome was
rebuilt, in its present form, in 1659, by Carlo Rainaldi, to
accommodate a miraculous image of the Virgin, to which
the cessation of the plague of 1656 was ascribed. The
church is sometimes called S. Maria in Portico, because of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
neighbouring Portico of Octavia. The miraculous Madonna
is placed now beneath the canopy over the high altar. It is
still believed to protect Rome from the contagion of pestilence.
Here, too, came constantly the Elder Pretender and
his son Henry, who took his Cardinal’s title from this
church, to offer prayers to this self-same image of the
Madonna, for the liberation of England from the plague of
Protestant apostasy. To this end James instituted in
perpetuity an office of prayer, and ordained that every
Saturday Mass should be said at 11 of the morning before
the picture, with the Sacrament exposed, and that after
recital of the prayers a blessing should be given along with
the Sacrament. This ceremony has ever since been regularly
performed.</p>

<p>In the sacristy is a framed engraving of the miraculous
Madonna, dated 1747. It is surrounded by a series of small
pictures, one of which shows the appearance of the image to
S. Galla in the pontificate of John I (523-6), as she ministered
to the wants of twelve poor men in her house. Another
shows Pope John dedicating the miraculous picture in the
oratory of S. Galla, which was transformed later into the
church of S. Maria in Campitelli. The remaining pictures
represent scenes in successive pontificates, in which this
miraculous Madonna brought about a cessation of plague.
A brief explanation in Latin is attached to each.</p>

<p>The plague of 1656 occurred in the pontificate of Alexander
VII. This Pope did much to atone for the craven
spirit of his papal predecessors by his courage and devotion
to his people throughout the epidemic. It is surprising that
no memorial has been erected to commemorate his services.</p>

<p>Two rare contemporary prints represent scenes in the
course of this visitation. One is figured by Lanciani in his
<i>Golden Days of the Renaissance</i>:<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> the other is reproduced
here.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Both were to be seen in the Medical Exhibition in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Castel S. Angelo in the spring of 1912. Lanciani’s print
shows the following scenes:</p>

<p>1. Inspection of the city gates by Prince Chigi.</p>

<p>2. Barge-loads of corpses from the lazaretto on the island
of S. Bartolommeo.</p>

<p>3-5. Various methods of fighting the plague in infected
districts.</p>

<p>6. The ‘Field of Death’ near St. Paul-outside-the-Walls.</p>

<p>The second print is of even greater interest than this:
the first two rows of plates give some idea of the character
of the lazarettos, and show how they were guarded by
palisades and sentries: they also show the carts for transport
of the sick attended by armed soldiers. The disinfection of
the books and personal ornaments of the sick, a dead dog
being dragged away to be thrown into the river, and a sick-cart
marked with a cross, are other details of interest. The
third row indicates the removal of infected goods to places
outside the city, where they were either washed or cleansed;
places where other things were deposited; a country
residence of the Popes converted into a convalescent home;
and the ruined palace of the Antonines, where woollen goods
were taken for disinfection. The fourth row represents
chiefly wash-houses and washing-places, to which clothes and
bedding were removed for cleansing. The fifth row, the
execution of those who transgressed the sanitary regulations,
the shooting of sick criminals, and the various measures
taken to restrict the river traffic. A cable is thrown across
the river, and palisades are erected on the shores, so as to
break all contact between the city and boats bringing in
provisions. The huts are shown, in which soldiers and
officials were lodged, whose duty it was to compel obedience
to the prescribed regulations.</p>

<p>The Great Plague of London, which reached its height
in 1665, has left an abundant aftermath both in literature
and art. The main story of its ravages is too well known to
call for repetition.</p>

<p>There were still some ready to see in the plague, as they
were in the case of the fire, evidence of the handiwork of
malevolent Jews. Since their expulsion from England by
Edward I, the Jews had never yet obtained the legal right
of re-entry, their open petition to Cromwell having failed.
With the restoration of Charles II to the throne, they seem
to have taken the matter into their own hands and found
their way quietly back, so that at the time of the plague
there were many resident in London, to the great advantage
of trade and to the relief of an ever-needy Government.
But three centuries of plague, punctuated by fierce outbreaks
at regularly recurring intervals, had served to unravel
much of the mystery of pestilence, and the people had
learnt that it was not to be exorcised by a holocaust of
Jews, or by the brutal murder of imaginary poisoners.</p>

<p>Celestial portents were not lacking to presage the plague.
A blazing comet appeared for several months before the
plague. Men affected to see, in its dull colour and slow
solemn movement, a prediction of the heavy punishment of
pestilence; whereas that which preceded the fire was swift
and flaming and foretold a rapid retribution.</p>

<p>Superstition raked up images afresh from the scrap-heap
of discarded fancies. Women saw flaming swords in the
heavens, some even saw angels brandishing them over
their heads. Astrologers had strange tales of malignant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
conjunctions of the planets. Medical opinion was still divided
along the same lines of cleavage, as it had been for 2,000
years before. There were those who referred the disease to
some occult poison, and those who referred it to an excess
of some manifest quality, such as heat, or cold, or moisture,
in each case corrupting the body humours. Speculation
was rife as to the nature of the causal poison. Some, as
Lucretius had done, conceived it to be pestiferous corpuscles
of atomic character, outside the range of human vision,
generated either in the heavens by a malignant conjunction
of planets, or in the soil, and so often liberated by the agency
of earthquakes. These poisons, however generated, found
their way into the human body through the medium of the
distempered atmosphere.</p>

<p>Some had noticed an unusual absence of birds before
the epidemic, as Thucydides and Livy had done in their
times. Boyle observed a great diminution of flies in 1665,
Boghurst a superabundance of flies and ants in 1664. Sir
George Ent and others attributed the disease to minute
invisible insects, but Blackmore conceived these to be rather
a consequence than a cause.</p>

<p>Insects, so called, had been vaguely associated with
pestilence from remote antiquity, more especially flies, lice,
and locusts; but in the medical literature of the sixteenth
century and after they are assigned a much more definite
rôle. Mercurialis<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> states that huge numbers of caterpillars
paraded the streets of Venice during the plague of 1576.
Goclenus[182] mentions swarms of spiders during the plague of
Hesse in 1612, and Hildanus swarms of flies and caterpillars
this same year in plague-stricken Lausanne. Bacon
speaks of flies and locusts, as characteristic of pestilential
years, and Diemerbroeck<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> of flies, gnats, butterflies, beetles,
grasshoppers, and hornets in the same connexion. Gottwald<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
reported the presence of multitudes of spiders during the
plague of Dantzig in 1709. Arabian physicians considered
the putrefaction of swarms of dead locusts an important
cause of pestilence. Hancock,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> as late as 1821, argued that
locusts caused famine by destroying the crops, and so prepared
the way for human pestilence.</p>

<p>Talismans, amulets, reliquaries, and all the stock-in-trade
of magic were in brisk demand among the populace. Quack
vendors of antipestilential remedies innumerable effectively
replaced physicians, most of whom took refuge in flight. All
honour to those who stood fast at their posts and reclaimed for
medicine what Galen had renounced, the captaincy of its own
soul. These are the men who had no fear for ‘the pestilence
that walketh in darkness or the arrow that flieth by day’:</p>

<p>And yet a few beside these, whose names are inscribed on
no human document, but whose deeds are imprinted in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
imperishable type on the deathless record of righteous
human endeavour.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Hodges<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> shows us something of the daily life
of a physician in the course of this plague. He himself
rose early, took his antipestilential dose, attended to the
affairs of his household, and then repaired to his consulting
room, where crowds awaited him. Some, who were sick, he
treated, others he reassured and sent away. Breakfast
followed, then visits to patients at their homes. On entering
a house he would vaporize some aromatic disinfectant on
a charcoal brazier: if he arrived out of breath, he would
rest a while, and then place a lozenge in his mouth, before
proceeding to the examination of his patients. After a round
of several hours’ duration, he would return home, drink
a glass of sack, and then dine on roast meat and pickles or
some similar condiments, all of which were reputed antidotal.
More wine followed the preliminary curtain-raiser. Afternoon
and evening, till eight or nine o’clock, were devoted
to a second round of visits. His late hours he spent at home,
a stranger to noxious fumes of tobacco, quaffing sack, to
ensure cheerfulness and certainty of sleep. Twice the
fatal infection seemed to have slipped past his outposts, but
Hodges had still his remedy: he merely doubled the dose.</p>

<p>Of all the literature of pestilence none has been more
widely read than Defoe’s <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i>: all
later records take their colour from Defoe. Nevertheless,
a careful study and comparison of other contemporary
accounts leaves little room for doubt that Defoe’s picture
does not accurately represent the general state of London
during the plague. His picture is far more true of Marseilles
in 1720 than of London in 1665, and in this connexion one
should remember that he had sedulously collected materials
for a diary of the plague of Marseilles, which have been
printed in some editions of his works. These can hardly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
have failed to colour his <i>Journal</i>, which was not submitted
to the public till 1722, two years after the plague of
Marseilles.</p>

<p>Defoe himself was but six years old at the time of the
plague, so that his own childish memories can have aided
him but little in his task. He will have had, at most, a dim
recollection of some hideous catastrophe, round which
ranged tales of parents and friends in his boyhood. To these
he will have added facts and incidents borrowed from the
chief records available in print. Intrinsic evidence goes to
show that these were three: London’s <i>Dreadful Visitation</i>,
Hodges’s <i>Loimologia</i>, and Vincent’s <i>God’s Terrible Voice in
the City</i>. The first of these will have given him the Bills
of Mortality and other general information: the second,
the aspect of the plague from a physician’s point of view:
the third, a vision of the plague as it appealed to popular
imagination.</p>

<p>That Defoe intended to write history and not fiction,
there is no reason to doubt. Judged only by the accuracy
of his facts it is history, but it is in the facts that he omits,
just because he had never heard of them, that he unconsciously
lapses into fiction. Comparison of details and
incidents with the unimpeachable record of Pepys confirms
his accuracy, but it shows also that, by separating incidents
from their surroundings and by compressing his description
to the exclusion of all but selected incidents, the picture,
as a whole, does not accurately represent the aspect of the
city, as it was. Pepys, who was an actual eyewitness, has
noted not only the most striking events but those of everyday
commonplace interest, so that his narrative is far more
true to life. Defoe, on the other hand, has removed his
picture from its setting. Pepys shows us that, though the
spectre of plague was everywhere, everyday life went on,
though in subdued fashion. Defoe would have us believe
that all activity was paralysed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>For all this, however, as one reads the <i>Journal</i> the narrative
has such an air of verisimilitude, that one instinctively
pictures the writer as describing what he has seen with his
own eyes, so perfect is the illusion. Mead, indeed, himself
an authority on the plague and so soon after the event,
believed that the <i>Journal</i> was the authentic record of an eyewitness.
Defoe’s faculty of visualizing what he has not seen
is inferior only to the vividness with which he describes
what he has visualized.</p>

<p>What is the secret of this vividness? More than all
else, extreme simplicity of language. The simple style
was Defoe’s natural style, and for that reason his use of it
is fluent and easy, and knowing this he fitly puts his story into
the mouth of a simple saddler. Defoe wrote for a growing
class of readers of a lowly social order. He is the apostle of
the common people: that is why he imitates their way of
speaking. Not only is his narrative colloquial, but it deliberately
affects the language a saddler would use in reciting
to his intimates the memories of what he had lived through.
There is no striving for dramatic effect, no drawing of
lurid pictures, no literary artifice, but always the same
sustained simplicity of diction, even in describing the most
appalling occurrences. There must be no chance of missing
the smallest point, so he even does such thinking as is
necessary by running comments on his own story.</p>

<p>The educated reader, particularly in these days, when even
literature is administered in tabloid form, must needs
be wearied by the prolixity, and irritated by the redundancy
of the narrative. But again it must be pleaded in extenuation
that these very defects are deliberate. Constant repetition,
as every teacher knows, sooner or later penetrates the
densest brain.</p>

<p>But the <i>Journal</i> is something more than a mere chronicle,
vivid enough at that, of what happened, and how men
behaved, during the plague. Defoe regards the plague as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
the judgement of God, and this attitude imparts a strong
moral purpose to the work. This is why he dwells so much
on the mental and moral effects of the catastrophe, inculcating
his lesson without the appearance of undue insistence.
Pepys, as we know, could find heart to make merry during
the plague, just as Boccaccio depicted his company of
Florentines: to Defoe the mere idea of merriment is revolting.
Pepys, on New Year’s Eve, as he looked back over the
abomination of desolation, could make this entry in his
<i>Diary</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘December 31, 1665. I have never lived so merrily (besides
that I never got so much) as I have done this plague time ...
and great store of dancings we have had at my cost (which
I am willing to indulge myself and wife) at my lodgings.
The great evil of this year, and the only one indeed, is the
fall of my Lord of Sandwich, whose mistake about the prizes
hath undone him.’</p>

</div>

<p>Pepys was a stranger to imagination: his pleasures and his
griefs were things of the surface and matters of the moment.
His creed is egoistic hedonism in all its naked brutishness.
He is far more concerned over the fire, where there is a
chance of losing his property, than over the plague where
the chance is of losing his life. His New Year’s Eve retrospect
is not the only glimpse he gives us of callous indifference
to the horrors of the plague. Look at September 30, 1665,
when the fiercest spell was only just past:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘So to sleep with a good deal of content, and saving only
this night and a day or two about the same business a month
or six weeks ago, I do end this month with the greatest
content, and may say that these three months, for joy,
health, and profit, have been much the greatest that ever
I received in all my life, having nothing upon me but the
consideration of the sicklinesse of the season during this
great plague to mortify mee. For all which the Lord God
be praised!’</p>

</div>

<p>It was not that Pepys was unconscious of the terrible
scenes of suffering around him, only that he was unmoved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
by them. Into one short letter to Lady Cartaret, at the
height of the plague, he compresses all the grim details
that fill a volume for Defoe.</p>

<p>Historians frequently lay it down that the fire of London
swept away the plague. As a fact it probably had little to
do with its departure. Several English towns were as hard
hit as London, and yet in the absence of any conflagration
subsidence and disappearance of plague followed the same
course as in London. At Salonica,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> about <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1500, a fire
which destroyed 8,000 houses was actually followed by an
outbreak of plague. It was a common contemporary belief
that the departure of plague from London was hastened by
the coming of pit-coal into general use, so that the atmosphere
was constantly permeated by sulphurous fumes.</p>

<p>Records in art of the Great Plague of London, though
numerous, are mostly unimportant. Generally artists have
been content to illustrate its copious literature. In 1863
Frederic Shields commenced an intended series of illustrations
of the <i>Journal</i> of Defoe. Ruskin lavished great praise
on the woodcuts, for their imaginative power and for the
superlative excellence of the design. Proofs of six of these
woodcuts were to be seen at the Memorial Exhibition of the
works of Shields (Alpine Club, September-October 1911).
The set of six comprised the following scenes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">1. <i>The Decision of Faith</i></p>

<p>A man is seated at a table, on which lies a Bill of Mortality,
with his Bible open before him. He says to himself, ‘Well
I know not what to do, Lord direct me.’ His finger points
to the answer in the open Bible: ‘Because thou hast made
the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy
habitation: there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any
plague come nigh thy dwelling.’</p>

<p class="center">2. <i>The Death of the First-born</i></p>

<p>A youth lies in convulsions on a bed, while a woman
kneels beside it. In the background are bearers carrying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
away a corpse: both are smoking pipes. On the ground
lies an hour-glass.</p>

<p class="center">3. <i>Solomon Eagle warning the Impenitent</i></p>

<p>Solomon Eagle stands with a brazier of live coals on his
head in a fierce preaching attitude before a group of lewd
young women at an open window.</p>

<p class="center">4. <i>The End of a Refugee</i></p>

<p>A man with a long hooked pole is dragging a corpse along.
Beside him stands a grave-digger with spade, dog, and
dinner-basket.</p>

<p class="center">5. <i>The Plague Pit</i></p>

<p>Bodies are being shot from a cart into a pit by the light of
a torch, which a man is holding.</p>

<p class="center">6. <i>Escape of an Imprisoned Family</i></p>

<p>The door of a house has been hacked down, and is lying
on a dead body.</p>

</div>

<p>George Cruickshank contributed four plates to Brayley’s
edition of the <i>Journal of the Plague Year</i>. Three of them,
the ‘Dead Cart’, the ‘Great Pit in Aldgate’, and ‘Solomon
Eagle’ are vivid and powerful; the fourth, ‘The Waterman’s
Wife’, feeble and commonplace.</p>

<p>The preaching of Solomon Eagle is the subject of a picture
by P. F. Poole, R.A., in the Mappin Gallery at Sheffield.
The scene depicted is taken from Harrison Ainsworth’s
novel <i>Old Saint Paul’s</i>. It shows Solomon Eagle, with the
brazier of live coals on his head, nude but for a loin-cloth;
and discoursing to the terrified citizens outside old St Paul’s
Cathedral, during the plague. All around are strewn bodies
of dead and dying: a house displays the damning red
cross and the words ‘Lord have mercy upon us’. In the
background bearers are carrying away a corpse to burial.</p>

<p>An incident, that Pepys describes in his <i>Diary</i> under
September 3, 1665, as follows, is represented in a modern
picture by Miss Florence Reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘Among other stories, one was very passionate, methought,
of a complaint brought against a man in the
towne for taking a child from London from an infected
house. Alderman Hooker told us it was the child of a very
able citizen in Gracious Street, a saddler, who had buried
all the rest of his children of the plague, and himself and
his wife now being shut up and in despair of escaping,
did desire only to save the life of this little child: and so
prevailed to have it received stark-naked into the arms
of a friend, who brought it (having put it into new fresh
clothes) to Greenwich; where, upon hearing the story, we
did agree it should be permitted to be received and kept
in the towne.’</p>

</div>

<p>In 1679 a terrible epidemic of plague broke out in Vienna,
then an opulent city, with a population of some 210,000, and
the seat of Leopold, the Holy Roman Emperor. Our chief
knowledge of the visitation is derived from Sorbait (<i>Consilium
medicum oder freundliches Gespräch</i>), Abraham a St. Clara
(Merk’s <i>Wien</i>), and Fuhrmann (<i>Alt- und Neu-Wien</i>). The
disease was preceded by an epidemic of the ‘Hot Sickness’,
(<i>Hitzige Krankheit</i>), which was very fatal. Bubonic plague
followed in its wake and Vienna presented the spectacle of
one huge lazaretto for the sick, one gigantic plague-pit for the
dead. Convicts, as at Naples, were employed both to nurse the
sick and bury the dead. Clothing, furniture, and bedding
lay littered in the streets mixed with the dead and dying.
When carts failed, the bodies were thrown into the Danube.
A Plague Committee strove in vain to shut up all infected
houses and segregate the inmates in lazarettos and stations
of quarantine. Death by public hanging was the penalty
of disobedience. Some of the royal princes, and foremost
among them Prince Ferdinand of Schwartzenburg, together
with many of the nobility, devoted themselves courageously
to fighting the plague, undertaking even the most menial
duties. But many of the citizens and the Emperor himself
fled. Leopold conceived his obligations to his people discharged
by a pilgrimage to Maria-Zell to pray for cessation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
of the plague. Then he moved his court to Prague, whence
plague drove him to Linz.</p>

<p>During the plague the Viennese set up a wooden column,
to which frequent processions were made, observing the
ancient ritual of the Flagellants. At the end of the plague
Leopold made a vow at St. Stephan’s to replace it by a
marble column, which was duly erected in the Graben
between 1687-93.</p>

<p>An incident of this plague, the story of the street-singer
Augustin, who was thrown alive, but drunk, into the
plague-pit, but escaped none the worse for his experience,
recalls the like occurrence in Defoe. The man is said to
have composed the familiar ‘O du lieber Augustin’ in a beer-house
on the very night he was thrown into the plague-pit.</p>

<p>Amulets of various kinds were extensively employed in
the seventeenth century. In South Germany a common
form was the so-called Pest Penny. These had on one face,
as a rule, the figure of St. Benedict or St. Zacharias, and on
the reverse some formula of exorcism.</p>

<p>Vienna<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> fell a victim to outbreak after outbreak of plague,
but the experience gained in the visitation of 1679 enabled
the authorities to stamp out the infection in 1691 and 1709,
before it had grown out of hand. But in 1713 all preventive
measures failed to check its spread. Then, in the month of
May, processions and litanies were organized to the plague
column. The Emperor Charles VI remained in Vienna, and
pronounced a solemn vow in St. Stephan’s, that if the
plague ceased he would erect a church as a thank-offering.
Such was the origin of the Karlskirche. This church is
a rich square edifice with a huge dome. It is the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i>
of J. B. Fischer von Erlach, commenced in 1715.
The ravages of the plague are portrayed in relief, by Stanetti,
in the tympanum. Flanking the portico are two domed
belfries, resembling Trajan’s column, 108 feet high, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
reliefs from the life of S. Carlo Borromeo by Mader and
Schletter. In March 1714, when the plague died out after
a total mortality of 120,000, a thanksgiving <i>Te Deum</i> was
sung in St. Stephan’s, at which the emperor was present.
Two series of memorial coins were struck, the one showing
the votive column, the other the church dedicated to
S. Carlo Borromeo.</p>

<p>The Plague Regulations, published in separate form at
Vienna at the time of this epidemic, give a good idea of
current popular opinion as to the nature of plague. There
was no lack of adherents for each belief of every preceding
period. There were those who regarded it as a signal evidence
of God’s displeasure. There were those who attributed it
to poison in the air or food, generated in the stars and spread
by the malice of grave-diggers for their own purposes. Even
the Jews were incriminated. There were those who read
its origin in the conjunction of certain stars. Others ascribed
it to famines, to poisonous fumes set free by earthquakes,
to comets, and even to dry seasons through the multiplication
of insects. Come how it might, clouds taking the
form of biers and funeral processions, noises in churchyards,
and dreary sounds in the air foretold its coming. On infected
bodies the virus was often visible as blue sulphurous fumes.
There were clearly also some who conceived a natural
origin. A doctor, named Gregorovius, dissected three dead
bodies in search of the cause, but failed to find it. His
intrepid zeal was duly rewarded by the Emperor and by
the Faculty of Medicine in Vienna.</p>

<p>Conformably with the varying conceptions of cause,
remedies were varied and multifarious. Some pinned their
faith to a devout life, aided by processions and penitential
sermons. Some lit fires to cleanse the air, at times adding
sulphur. A host of herbs, chief among them Angelica,
enjoyed repute as antipestilential remedies. The simple
life appealed to some, purgatives and blood-letting to others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>But side by side with this ill-assorted medley of measures,
a code of sanitary precautions had slowly grown up. Early
notification by the doctors, quarantine of suspects and
segregation of the sick, cleanliness and disinfection were all
recommended and sedulously executed, and supplied in
embryo the essential principles of modern sanitary science.
Doctors were enjoined to keep sober, to fumigate themselves,
and to wear silk or taffetas, to which the virus would not
cling. We have arrived indeed at the parting of the ways,
and henceforth the stream of medical science, polluted less
and less by the surface waters of superstition, flows on clear
and full in its appointed channel. The sun of science emerges
at length from its protracted winter solstice.</p>

</div>

<p>In the year 1720 plague found its way to Marseilles. It
was believed to have been brought by a ship, the <i>Grand-Saint-Antoine</i>,
which arrived on May 25 from the Levant.
As usual, the attempt was made to hush it up for the sake
of trade. At the beginning of August something had to be
done, so on the advice of two physicians, Sicard, father
and son, it was decided to light bonfires throughout the city.
For lack of firewood this was not done, but also for lack of
faith, for it was found that despite their vaunted specific,
the Sicards had fled the city. So sulphur was served out
to the poor instead, wherewith to ‘perfume’ their houses.</p>

<p>As early as August 2 the Town Council found it necessary
to adopt special measures to keep physicians and surgeons
to their task. Accordingly, they decided that the city should
pay them a fixed salary in place of fees from the sick, and
allow them smocks of oiled cloth, and sedan chairs to carry
them on their rounds. There are several illustrations extant
of the dress adopted by doctors in the plague of Marseilles.
The same dress, with trifling variations, was worn elsewhere
in France, in Switzerland, and in Germany, and had originated
in Italy. It is shown in an old Venetian woodcut of
<span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 1493, from the works of Joannes de Ketham (<i>Fasciculus
Medicinae</i>, 1493). This woodcut shows a physician in a long
overall, but wearing only a skull-cap on his head, visiting
a plague patient in bed. He is accompanied by attendants
who carry lighted torches, while he himself holds a medicated
sponge before his mouth and nose, as he feels the pulse.
Grillot figured the dress as the frontispiece of his <i>Lyon
affligé de la peste 1629</i>, and Manget<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> has borrowed it from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
him. From his description it would seem that the mantle,
breeches, shirt, boots, gloves, and hat were all of morocco
leather. The beak attached to the mask was filled with
aromatics, over which the air passed in respiration, and had
an aperture for each eye, fitted with a disk of crystal.</p>

<p>M. Reber<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> describes an engraving by John Melchior
Fuesslin, representing a doctor in the plague of Marseilles.
The legend beneath it, in German, is (translated) ‘Sketch
of a Cordovan-leather-clad doctor of Marseilles, having also
a nose-case filled with smoking material to keep off the
plague. With the wand he is to feel the pulse.’ Reber’s
and Manget’s plates are both reproduced in the Bristol
<i>Medico-Chirurgical Journal</i>, March 1898, from the <i>Janus</i>
blocks. Gaffarel<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> gives the costumes both of a doctor and
of a hospital attendant: they closely resemble the dress of
the Italian charitable guilds of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>By August 9 some of the physicians and almost all the
master-surgeons had fled, and an ordinance was issued
demanding their return, or in default their expulsion from
their respective corporations, and other special penalties
as well. Two physicians named Gayon volunteered their
services for the Hôpital des Convalescents, but forthwith
paid the penalty with their lives. In the absence of sufficient
physicians in Marseilles, others were summoned from
Montpellier, Paris, and elsewhere. These exhausted their
energies in a dispute over the contagious character of plague.
Chicoyneau and Chirac maintained that it was not contagious.
Deidier proved, by successfully inoculating dogs
with bile taken from plague subjects, that at any rate it was
communicable. Each subsequently expounded his views
in a formal discourse before the School of Montpellier.</p>

<p>Existing hospital accommodation was quite unequal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
to the needs. Emergency tents were erected outside the
town, with mattresses for the sick. Chevalier Rose equipped
and maintained a hospital in the district entrusted to him,
at his own expense. A large temporary hospital of timber
covered with sail-cloth was hurriedly erected, but when
almost finished towards the end of September it was blown
down by a gale, and was not rebuilt till October 4. This
hospital, together with the Hôpital Général de la Charité
of 800 beds, provided ultimately sufficient accommodation,
so that none need remain in the streets.</p>

<p>From the first the mortality was such that it was wellnigh
impossible to bury the dead. On August 8 the Assembly
resolved that carts should be used to carry the dead to
burial, and that pits should be dug in which the bodies
could be buried in lime. So two huge pits were dug outside
the walls, between the gate of Aix and that of Joliette,
M. Moustier overseeing the diggers and compelling them to
work. Chevalier Rose also had pits dug and organized
a corps of buriers in his own district. The duties of burial
were at first entrusted to sturdy beggars, but in a brief
space of time the supply of these failed, so that bodies
began to accumulate in the houses and streets. Then
convicts were requisitioned in relays from time to time.</p>

<p>These convicts were promised their liberty, to excite them
to work—a promise that was never fulfilled in the case of
the few who survived the task. Their ignorance of the
management of carts and horses, their idleness and lust of
robbery rendered them so unfit for the task, that Moustier
and the other sheriffs and Chevalier Rose were compelled
to be always present on horseback, to superintend the work.
By August 21 corpses had already begun to accumulate in
old parts of the city, where the streets were too narrow and
steep for the carts to go. Accordingly, an order was issued
that the vaults of the churches in the upper town should
be used for burials in quicklime, and that, when full, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
should be sealed up with cement. By the end of August
the streets were literally strewn with dead bodies, some
in an advanced stage of putrefaction, mingled with cats and
dogs that had been killed, and bedding thrown out from the
houses. The square in front of the building called the
Loge, as also the Palissadoes of the port, were filled with
bodies brought ashore from ships in the roadstead, to which
whole families had fled in the belief that plague would not
reach them on the water.</p>

<p>By September 6 more than 2,000 dead bodies were lying
in the streets, exclusive of those in the houses. On the
esplanade called La Tourette, lying towards the sea between
the houses and the rampart, 1,000 corpses had lain rotting for
weeks in the sun and emitting a frightful stench. They were
too rotten even to be lifted into carts, and too foul to be carried
to distant pits. Chevalier Rose, mindful maybe of Procopius,
conceived the idea of throwing them into two huge
vaults in the old bastions close to the esplanade, after breaking
in their roofs. The task was carried out in fierce haste by
100 galley-slaves, who tied handkerchiefs dipped in vinegar
over their mouths and noses. At the same time fishermen
netted 10,000 dead dogs floating in the port and towed them
out to sea.</p>

<p>In the parish of St. Ferriol, the finest quarter of the city,
Michel Serre the painter undertook to see to the burial of
the dead, with carts and galley-slaves placed at his disposal,
himself providing food and lodging for the workers. A
grateful city has repaid him by hanging his two large
pictures of Marseilles during the plague close beneath the
ceiling of an underground cellar, where it is impossible to
decipher their details.</p>

<p>When all the bodies were disposed of, the sheriffs employed
the galley-slaves to clear the filth from the streets and throw
it into barges, which carried it out to sea.</p>

<p>In the early days of the epidemic, the sheriffs had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
forbidden the annual procession on August 16, in honour of
St. Roch, at which the saint’s bust and relics were carried
through the streets; but the people raised such an outcry
that the procession was celebrated, the sheriffs attending
with their halberdiers to prevent a crowd following. By
September 7 even the civil authorities had come to regard the
plague as an instrument of God’s wrath, and the magistrates,
to appease it, vowed that every year the city should give
2,000 livres to a House of Charity, to be established under
the protection of our Lady of Good Help, for orphans of
the province.</p>

<p>At the height of the plague many parish priests and some
of the monks fled: the services of the Church were mostly
suspended. But many secular clergy and monks remained
and devoted themselves unflinchingly to the sick. The
bishop, Belsunce, nobly played his part. Wherever the
poorest lay, there he went confessing, consoling, and exhorting
them to patience. To the dying he carried the Sacrament,
to the destitute the whole of his money in alms.
Though plague invaded his palace and carried off those about
him, it spared him. It is of him that Pope<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> asks,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Why drew Marseilles’ good Bishop purer breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When nature sickened, and each gale was death?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On All Saints’ Day, Belsunce headed a procession through
the streets from his palace, walking barefoot, as Borromeo
of old, with a halter about his neck, and carrying the cross
in his arms. He wished to appear among his people as
a scapegoat laden with their sins, and as a victim destined to
expiate them. Accompanied by the priests and canons of
the Church he led the way to a place where an altar had
been erected. There, after exhorting the people to repentance,
he celebrated Mass before them all. Then he solemnly
consecrated the city to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, in honour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
of which he had instituted a yearly festival. The tears
coursing down his face as he spoke moved all to cry aloud
to the Lord for mercy. On November 16 Belsunce was
emboldened to exorcise the waning plague. Calling together
all that remained of the clergy to the church of Acoulles,
he read all the prayers that the Pope had prescribed for
deliverance from plague. Then after an eloquent and moving
exhortation he carried up the Holy Sacrament to the cathedral’s
roof, and there, under the open sky, with all the city
lying before him, uttered a solemn benediction, and performed
the full ritual of exorcism according to the forms of the
Roman Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Belsunce was not the first human scapegoat to tread the
streets of Marseilles in voluntary expiation for its people.
In times of pestilence, in the old Greek colony of Massilia,
one of the lower orders offered himself on behalf of his
fellow citizens. Dressed in sacred garments and decked with
sacred boughs he was led through the streets, amid the prayers
of the people that their ills might fall on him, and then cast
out of the city.</p>

<p>There stands this day on a lofty crest of land in the open
square, right in front of the episcopal palace of Marseilles,
a statue of Belsunce in bronze, by Ramus. The stone
pedestal bears a commemorative inscription and two reliefs
in bronze. In one, Marseilles in woman’s form is lying among
her stricken children, while Belsunce and his attendant
priests implore the Sacred Heart to stay the plague. In the
other, Belsunce bears the Sacrament to sick and dying.</p>

<p>The statue of Belsunce, clad in full episcopal robes, stands
with face raised and arms outstretched to heaven, in attitude
of earnest supplication. Before him Nature has set a landscape
of surpassing beauty: sea, earth, and sky give freely
of their best. Far down below a polyglot people move
hither and thither around the harbour quays, like ants,
at their appointed tasks. Beyond it spreads a matchless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
expanse of Mediterranean sea, now smooth and silvery as
a mirror, now fretful with the rising tide. Away over the
sea and over the low land that bounds the bay, the evening
sun lights up the face of Belsunce with a last lingering
radiance, as it goes down to its setting in a glory of golden
hues. If man’s graven image may enjoy the perfect happiness
denied to man, then surely Belsunce has his reward.</p>

<p>Marseilles is rich in reminiscence of her bishop. In the
Bureau d’Intendance Sanitaire hangs a pleasing portrait
of Belsunce by Gobert; while in the Musée may be seen
a poor picture, by Mansian, of him giving the Sacrament
to the victims of the plague. François Gérard (1770-1837)
presented his ‘Peste de Marseille’ to the Bureau d’Intendance
Sanitaire, where now it hangs. The wan dismal colouring
of the picture accords ill with the striking vigour of the
composition. In the foreground is set forth the whole
tragedy of a family stricken with plague. On the ground
lies the father writhing with agony: his hands are clenched,
his eyes are starting from their sockets: the dressing in
the right armpit indicates one site of the disease. The
mother, seated on a chest, clasps to her body her elder boy,
wrapped in a blanket, too weak to stand: the younger
child leans against his mother, his eyes fixed in terror on his
dying father. Anguish is depicted in the death-like pallor
of the mother’s face. In the background Belsunce in full
robes distributes to the sick and starving poor the bread
which an attendant is carrying. To the left of the foreground
bodies of the dead are lying huddled up beneath an awning,
while to the right convicts are dragging corpses away for
burial. The sublime serenity of the good bishop seems to
bring to his stricken people in their anguish some promise
of that peace which passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>J. F. de Troy the younger (1679-1752), himself an eyewitness
of this plague, painted a masterly picture, which
is now in the city Musée. It was executed for Chevalier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Rose in 1722. It depicts him seated on a white horse calmly
directing the work of the convicts, who have been assigned
to him, as they clear the esplanade of La Tourette of the
accumulation of decomposing corpses. The sheriffs, also
on horseback, aid the Chevalier in his task. The ground is
strewn with corpses, which the convicts seize and hurl into
the gaping mouths of the open vaults in the bastions. They
work in furious haste, impelled by the foul odour of the bodies
and the knowledge of the hazard of their task. Ferocity is
depicted in their faces, haste in all the movements of their
bodies. The whole scene is full of life and movement and
spirit. In the sky hover angels shaking flaming torches.
The colouring has been managed with wonderful effect to
convey the feeling that sky and earth alike are filled with
a poisonous and sickly miasma.</p>

<p>In another picture in the Santé at Marseilles Guérin has
treated the same subject in a dull conventional manner.
Chevalier Rose, bearing the dead body of a woman, fills the
centre of the picture. Behind him a ludicrous boy is holding
a white horse with one hand, and his nose with the other,
and is bestowing on his nose a tenacious grip that would
have been more appropriately bestowed on the horse.
Convicts are dragging away the dead bodies that litter the
ground.</p>

<p>The two large pictures by Michel Serre are of interest
rather as pictorial records of old Marseilles, than as contributions
to the artistic presentation of plague. One represents
the Cours de Marseille, now known as the Cours Belsunce,
during the plague. It is a handsome boulevard bordered
on either side by trees, beneath which are seen tents hastily
erected as temporary dwellings by those who have fled
from their plague-contaminated dwellings to the shelter of
the streets. Death and disease have followed them and are
rampant on every side. Buriers are seen collecting the
dead and carrying them off in carts. This picture has been
engraved by Rigaud, and is figured in Crowle’s <i>Illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
Pennant’s London</i>, vol. x, p. 93; also in Gaffarel’s <i>La
Peste de 1720</i>, p. 304.</p>

<p>The other picture by Serre shows the open space in front
of the Hôtel de Ville together with part of the port of
Marseilles. The scenes resemble those of his other picture,
and we are reminded also that many took refuge in boats
and anchored off the harbour, in the vain belief that plague
could not reach them there. The space before the Town Hall
became one heap of decomposing bodies that were landed
from the boats or had drifted ashore from the waters of the
harbour. Crowle<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> figures this picture as well as the preceding,
so, too, does Gaffarel.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>With the departure of plague from Marseilles, the disease
had wellnigh disappeared from Europe. In the Levant it
still flourished for a while. Patrick Russell, physician to the
British factory at Aleppo, wrote a treatise on an epidemic
that occurred during his residence there from 1760-2.
Again, in 1771 it gained a footing at Moscow, claiming there
no less than 80,000 victims. It was in vain that the people
thronged the miraculous <i>ikon</i> of the Virgin at the Varvarka
gate. Fearing the great concourse, the archbishop had the
<i>ikon</i> removed to the Chudok monastery, but such was the
fury of the maddened people, that they threatened to raze
the building to the ground if the <i>ikon</i> were not restored.
The archbishop yielded, but too late, for the mob dragged
him from his monastery and massacred him in the open
street. From that day the plague began to wane. So plague
was banished from Europe by the worship of a picture, and
with dramatic appropriateness the curtain fell on the final
act in a scene of human sacrifice.</p>

<p class="caption">By Baron Gros</p>

<p class="caption-r">(Face <a href="#Page_208">Page 208</a>)</p>

</div>

<p>The celebrated picture ‘Les Pestiférés de Jaffa’ by Baron
Gros, now in the Louvre, has been the subject of much
acrimonious controversy. The picture was ordered by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
Napoleon when First Consul, and excited extravagant enthusiasm
on its exhibition in the Salon in 1804. Artists placed
a palm-branch over it, and the public covered the whole
frame with wreaths. It is, in fact, a large unattractive
canvas, devoid of any exceptional merit either of composition
or colour. It shows Napoleon accompanied by some of his
staff standing among the plague-stricken soldiers in the
interior of a mosque. One of the men is raising his right arm,
so as to expose the bubo in his armpit, and Napoleon is
laying his fingers on it.</p>

<p>There is also in existence a rough sketch,<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> which shows that
Gros at the outset intended to present his subject differently.
Napoleon, like St. Louis in the modern fresco in St. Sulpice,
holds in his arms the body of a plague victim, which an Arab
helps him to support. The general’s impassive features
contrast strongly with the frightened appearance of his
attendants.</p>

<p>Each of these two representations would seem to be
actual historical occurrences during Napoleon’s campaign
in Syria. Plague had broken out among the troops in Jaffa,
where Napoleon had established a large hospital, and the
generals had issued an alarming report as to its spread. It
was Napoleon’s purpose to restore the <i>moral</i> of his army,
which had been seriously affected by the outbreak. Norvin<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
represents Napoleon as visiting all the wards, accompanied
by the generals Berthier and Bezzières, the director-general
Daure, and the head doctor Desgenettes. Napoleon spoke
to the sick, encouraged them, and touched their wounds,
saying, ‘You see, it is nothing.’ When he left the hospital,
they blamed his imprudence. He replied coldly, ‘It is my
duty, I am the general-in-chief.’ This studied indifference
to the contagion, coupled with the fine behaviour of the
head doctor Desgenettes, who inoculated himself with plague<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
in the presence of the soldiers and applied to himself the same
remedies as he prescribed for them, successfully accomplished
Napoleon’s purpose. The account of the incident
given in a letter<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> by Comte d’Aure is slightly different.
It runs, ‘He did more than touch the buboes: assisted by
a Turkish orderly, General Buonaparte picked up and carried
away a plague patient, who was lying across a doorway of
one of the wards: we were much frightened at his acting
thus, because the sick man’s clothing was covered with
foam and the disgusting discharge from a broken bubo.
The general continued his visit unmoved and interested,
spoke to the sick, and sought in addressing them with
words of consolation, to dissipate the panic that the
plague was casting on their spirits.’ Bourrienne,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Napoleon’s
secretary, however, says, ‘I walked by the general’s side,
and I assert that I never saw him touch any of the
infected.’</p>

<p>The Duc de Rovigo in his <i>Memoirs</i> practically corroborates
the Comte d’Aure. He says: ‘In order to convince
them by the most obvious proof that their apprehensions
were groundless, he desired that the bleeding tumour of one
of his soldiers should be uncovered before him, and pressed
it with his own hands.’ Desgenettes and General Andréossy,
who were both present, confirm Rovigo and Comte d’Aure
as against Bourrienne.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s secretary carries the narrative a stage further.
He says that only sixty of those in the hospital had plague,
and that as their removal involved a risk of infecting the
whole army, Napoleon deliberated with his staff and the
medical men, and decided to put them out of their misery
by poison. Bourrienne says that he does not know who
administered the poison, but that there was no question of
their destruction. Bourrienne’s statements on any subject,
as is generally recognized, need careful sifting, but out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
mass of conflicting testimony the plain fact would seem to
emerge, that Napoleon did suggest that the death of some
seven or eight, who were bound to die, should be accelerated,
so that they might not infect the whole army. Napoleon
himself, at St. Helena, did not deny this, and defended his
action on the ground of humanity, stigmatizing the story of
wholesale poisoning as an invention.</p>

<p>The statement of Thucydides, that all other diseases took on
the similitude of the dominating pestilence, is one that reappears
constantly in the literature of epidemic disease. We have already
noted the frequent concurrence of plague and typhus, leading
such acute observers as Diemerbroeck and Sydenham to believe
that the one disease might be transformed into the other. The
same close association of relapsing fever and typhus was constantly
noted, and we know now that the explanation lies in the
fact that each disease is transmitted by the body-louse, as
plague is transmitted by the flea. Bearing in mind the close
and constant association of these and other acute infectious
fevers it is no matter for surprise that they should have been
regarded as states and stages of one pestilential process, differing
from one another, not in kind, but only in degree. As Bacon
says, ‘putrefaction rises not to its height at once.’</p>

<p>The acute, often abrupt, onset of the Athenian pestilence, with
profound depression, severe headache, and suffused conjunctivae,
though met with in a moiety of cases of plague, is eminently
characteristic of typhus. The striking appearance of the bloodshot
eyeballs has led to much confusion between the two diseases.</p>

<p>The aspect of the tongue and fauces inclines rather to the side
of typhus. In each disease the tongue is at first heavily coated
with a thick white fur, and tends later to become dry and parched.
But in typhus there is a special tendency, as the disease advances,
for the tongue to bleed from fissures at the edges. So frequently
is this the case, that this feature has been regarded as of diagnostic
value in the presence of an outbreak of typhus. A boggy
reddened appearance of the fauces is usual in typhus, and is
seen also in a proportion of plague patients.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>Unnatural and even foetid breath may be met with in any
acute infectious fever, but foetor is in no way characteristic of
any. Doubtless it was far more common in times when the
alphabet of oral hygiene had not yet found acceptance as a
necessary detail of medical regimen. Murchison describes the
breath of typhus patients as foetid, and in addition it is well
known that a repulsive odour may be given off from their bodies.
Salius Diversus mentioned it three centuries ago, and it has
been a commonplace of many subsequent writers. Curschmann
failed to detect it, and attributed its absence to the free ventilation
of the sick wards. A layman, as Thucydides was, might well
ascribe to the breath a foetor permeating the whole atmosphere
around the patient.</p>

<p>Sneezing has long been associated in popular tradition with
plague, and an old legend refers the association to the plague of
Rome at the commencement of the pontificate of Gregory the
Great, when it is said that those who sneezed died. The most
careful and observant of modern physicians do not, however,
confirm the connexion. Russell states that he was on the look
out for it during the plague of Aleppo and did not observe it:
Simpson does not even mention it. Nor does it appear to be
noteworthy as a symptom either of typhus or of any other acute
infectious fever, though it would be in accord with the swollen
and congested state of the nasal mucosa in typhus, to which
Curschmann has drawn special attention. Perhaps the tradition
is a mere old wives’ tale, for sneezing has been regarded as an
ominous sign from great antiquity, and as far back at least as the
composition of the <i>Odyssey</i>. Aristotle frankly confessed himself
unable to explain the connexion.</p>

<p>Curschmann met with hoarseness and laryngeal catarrh
commonly in typhus, but though catarrh of the whole respiratory
tract may occur in plague, it is not an outstanding feature.
Cough is frequent in either disease; so also is vomiting, often
of great severity: and if protracted will exhibit a succession of
changes of colour, such as Thucydides has described, first the
food contents of the stomach, then green bilious vomit, and
finally blood, either red or altered to brown or black. Hiccough
and empty retching are liable to ensue on severe vomiting from
any enduring cause.</p>

<p>It is not clear to what Thucydides appropriates the term<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
σπασμός: the context would suggest that spasm of the diaphragm,
such as accompanies protracted vomiting, is indicated.
But it may also signify true convulsions, which are an occasional
complication of both diseases. Convulsive tremor of the limbs,
and indeed of the whole body, is habitual at the height of typhus,
and is not infrequent in plague.</p>

<p>We should naturally look to the appearance of the skin and of
the eruption to afford criteria for a sure diagnosis, but such is
not the case. True, there is a remarkable resemblance to
Murchison’s description of the skin of typhus patients, in an
English hospital. ‘The face’, he says, ‘is often flushed. The
flushing is general over the entire face. It is never pink: sometimes
it is reddish or reddish brown, but more commonly it is of
a dusky, earthy, or leaden hue: in grave cases it may be livid.’
No corresponding appearance of the skin is to be seen in
plague.</p>

<p>Thucydides has described the eruption as consisting of
φλύκταιναι μικραὶ καὶ ἕλκη, words that have generally been
rendered as ‘small blisters and ulcers’, and for this reason
have been held to exclude positively a diagnosis of typhus fever.
So certain a conclusion is hardly justified by the facts. Outbreaks
of gangrenous dermatitis, in which multiple bullae or blisters,
leaving an ulcerated base, have broken out over the body surface,
have been not uncommon features of a typhus epidemic, and from
their virulently contagious character such outbreaks would have
been more prone to occur amid all the neglect and destitution
of a beleaguered garrison. Murchison has described the resulting
appearances in the following words: ‘I have seen bullae filled
with light or dark fluid, or large pustules appear on various parts
of the body during the progress of the fever. Stokes has observed
bullae of this description followed after bursting by deep ulcers
with sharp margins.’ But extensive ulceration such as this
must inevitably have left permanent scarring, at least as marked
as the ‘pitting’ produced by small-pox, and we can hardly
presume that this could have escaped the critical Greek eye of
so keen an observer as Thucydides. The whole question arises
of the exact significance of the words ἕλκος and φλύκταιναι.</p>

<p>In his treatise Περὶ Ἑλκῶν Hippocrates uses the term ἕλκος
not only for open wounds and ulcers, but also for burns, wheals,
and wounds in general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>Homer uses it for wounds of every kind. It so happens that
the wounds of the <i>Iliad</i> are almost all the open wounds produced
by spear and arrow, but Homer also uses it for the bite of
a snake<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and for the wound inflicted by lightning.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Bion<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> uses it in consecutive lines for the wound caused by
a spear, and in the generic sense:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ἄγριον, ἄγριον ἕλκος ἔχει κατὰ μηρὸν Ἄδωνις,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">μεῖζον δ’ ἁ Κυθέρεια φέρει ποτικάρδιον ἕλκος.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Aeschylus<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> and Sophocles<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> use it also in the wider sense, as in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">πόλει μὲν ἕλκος ἓν τὸ δήμιον τυχεῖν,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent32">τί γὰρ</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">γένοιτ’ ἂν ἕλκος μεῖζον ἢ φίλος κακός;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The inference to be drawn from these passages is that ἕλκος,
although usually indicating an open wound, is used with no
precise significance.</p>

<p>The same difficulty attaches to the word φλύκταινα. Though
Hippocrates uses the word frequently, there is no single passage
in which the precise significance is clear beyond all doubt. He
applies it to chilblains,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> to an eruption on the skin of subjects of
empyema,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> to lesions appearing on the tongue in fatal septic
cases, and so on. In one passage, in which he speaks of a
φλύκταινα arising from rubbing the skin with vinegar, he seems
to indicate a blister.</p>

<p>The first clear definition of the term we have is from the pen
of Celsus, who defines it as a discoloured pustule that breaks
and leaves an ulcerated base (‘genus pustularum, cum plures
similes varis oriuntur nonnunquam maiores, lividae aut pallidae
aut nigrae aut aliter naturali colore mutato: subestque iis
humor, ubi hae ruptae sunt, infra quasi exulcerata caro apparet’).
There are several passages in Aristophanes, which indicate that
he at any rate applied the term as we do to a blister lesion:
but at the same time, there are other passages in which this
exclusive use is by no means so sure. The lesion resulting from
rowing<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> or carrying a lance<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> cannot well be other than a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
blister. And there is a passage in the <i>Ecclesiazusae</i>,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> which seems
even clearer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">ἀλλ’ ἔμπουσά τις</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ἐξ αἵματος φλύκταιναν ἠμφιεσμένη,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">‘Some vampire bloated with blood like a blister.’ The image
must be that of a vampire, so bloated with blood, that its body
seems actually enveloped in it, simulating a blood-blister.</p>

<p>Aristotle applies the term to the bite of a shrew-mouse, which
would presumably produce a solid local swelling, and not a
blister. Procopius uses φλύκταινα for the black cutaneous lesions
of Oriental plague, known nowadays as pustules: he says, too,
that they were of the size of a lentil, but does not mention
terminal ulceration. Procopius is so precise in his medical
terminology, that it is improbable he borrowed the term from
Thucydides without appreciating its exact significance: far
more likely he adopted it from the medical terminology of his
day.</p>

<p>There is something to be said for appropriating the terms used
by Thucydides to the pustular lesions of Oriental plague. Many
writers, ancient as well as modern, have described the so-called
pustules as commencing in some cases as blisters and terminating
in eroding ulcers. But, on the other hand, we know nothing of
epidemics of plague without a considerable proportion of bubonic
cases, while we do know from the narrative of Procopius that
plague has maintained its characters unchanged for 1,500 years.
In an epidemic of plague, in which death did not supervene till
the seventh or ninth day the presence of buboes would be the
outstanding feature of the disease, and Thucydides does not even
mention them.</p>

<p>Assuming that typhus fever also has maintained its characters
unchanged, and that the external manifestations of the Athenian
pestilence were not of the exceptional type we have alluded to,
but of the type habitually associated with the disease, can it
reasonably be contended that the terms φλύκταιναι and ἕλκη
are applicable to these?</p>

<p>Murchison says that ‘according to its colour, the eruption
may be said to pass through three stages, viz. 1, Pale dirty pink
or florid; 2, reddish brown or rusty; 3, livid or petechial’. In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
the first stage, it is generally admitted that except on careful
observation, and in a good light, the faint diffuse maculae (spots)
are apt to escape detection, so that the impression is of a general
suffusion of the skin—what in fact Thucydides terms ὑπέρυθρον.</p>

<p>In the second stage, the deeper coloration of the spots throws
them into relief as individual lesions against the paler background
of general suffusion of the skin. Can it be that this is
indicated by the vague term φλύκταινα? Be it remembered
that Thucydides was a layman, describing, as he says, the
lesions of a hitherto unknown disease. Every physician is well
aware of the restricted terminology that the laity possess for
the description of multifarious lesions. Medicine itself is not
exempt from the same confusion, for when physicians glibly
speak of the subcutaneous haemorrhages of typhus as petechiae
they forget that the word throws back to <i>petigo</i> (a scab).</p>

<p>There remains then for the third stage of the eruption—the
haemorrhagic stage—the term ἕλκος, a generic term applicable
to almost any lesion, and having no philological affinity to the
Latin <i>ulcus</i>, and the English ‘ulcer’, with which medical usage
has confused it.</p>

<p>Reviewing, then, all the facts, it cannot be held that the description
of the eruption, as given by Thucydides, is sufficient to
negative a diagnosis of typhus fever, which disease is otherwise
depicted to the life in all else that he says of its clinical course
and characters.</p>

<p>Thucydides was so impressed with the intensity of the
internal fever, that he expected certainly to find a corresponding
temperature of the body surface: hence his surprise is
obvious at finding it not excessively hot. For all that, sufferers
were ready to cast off every shred of clothing, till they were
naked, and longed to throw themselves into cold water. Some
did actually plunge into cisterns, but no amount of water sufficed
to slake their thirst. Procopius mentions this same fierce longing
to fling themselves into water among the plague victims of
Byzantium, but raving delirium of this kind is far more characteristic
of typhus than of plague. Curschmann depicts the fierce
medley of wild ravings, mingled with frantic efforts at self-destruction,
which give an unmistakable character to a ward of
typhus patients. Murchison, quoting from Bancroft, says:
‘Some leaving their beds would beat their keepers or nurses and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
drive them from their presence: others, like madmen, would run
about the streets, markets, lanes, and other places: and some again
would leap headlong into deep waters.’ Intolerable restlessness
and insomnia fill up the cup of misery to overflowing. Curschmann
confirms the observation of Thucydides, that typhus cadavers exhibit
very little emaciation, but this does not help to differentiate
typhus from other acute fevers of equally brief duration.</p>

<p>Death commonly occurred on the seventh or the ninth day.
One recognizes here submission to the authoritative doctrine of
critical days. Hippocrates<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> defined them on the basis of equal
and unequal numbers:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Equal—4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 28, 30, 48, 60, 80, 100.</p>

<p>Unequal—5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 21, 27, 31.</p>

</div>

<p>Taking the mean of the numbers, the plague of Athens claimed
its victims for the most part about the eighth day of the disease.
A layman would hardly have had the opportunity, or indeed the
inclination, to make an exact statistical computation, and in this
fact perhaps lies this unexpected lapse of Thucydides into
subservience to medical orthodoxy.</p>

<p>With regard to the day of death in typhus fever, Curschmann
says: ‘When death is caused simply by the severity of the
disease, it occurs usually in the middle or second half of the
second week. A fatal termination before the ninth day, or as
early as the fifth or sixth day, occurs only in the most severe
forms of the disease, or in individuals with little resisting power.’
Now, not only was the Athenian pestilence severe in type, but
there was also an almost complete absence of the nursing and
medical regimen that will have served to prolong the duration
of cases, that have ultimately proved fatal, in recent epidemics.
In plague death usually occurs between the second and sixth
days, seldom later, and few patients survive to the seventh or
ninth day without the appearance of buboes.</p>

<p>If the victims survived this period, the disease fastened on
the bowels and produced violent ulceration (ἕλκωσις). Initial
constipation, followed, as the disease develops, by diarrhoea,
which is sometimes profuse and intractable, is met with both in
typhus and plague.</p>

<p>The disease began in the head and gradually passed through
the whole body. If the sufferer survived so long, it would often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
seize the extremities and make its mark, attacking the privy
parts and fingers and toes. Some escaped with the loss of these
and with the loss of their eyes. This terminal gangrene of the
extremities is of frequent occurrence in typhus, but is rare in
plague, and very rare in other acute infectious fevers. Curschmann
says: ‘Many patients continue to suffer for some time
after defervescence (of typhus fever) from gangrene of the ears,
fingers, toes, tip of the nose, and skin of the penis and scrotum,
arising during the febrile period.’ Gangrenous changes around
a carbuncle are occasional in plague, but not as an independent
affection of the extremities. Neglected plague buboes, even nowadays
in Indian epidemics, do exceptionally become gangrenous,
as the result of an intercurrent erysipelas. Necrotic ulceration of
the eyeballs is well authenticated as a complication of typhus
as well as of plague.</p>

<p>Some recovered from the disease, but with complete loss of
memory. This again is a frequent consequence, usually temporary,
but sometimes permanent, of typhus. According to
Curschmann, ‘the patient’s recollection of his illness is almost
always very limited in severe or moderately severe cases. True
psychoses appear to be rare during convalescence. Mild melancholia
and hallucinations are sometimes seen, and even mania
has been observed.’</p>

<p>The combination of gangrene with mental symptoms inevitably
suggests the thought of ergotism (poisoning by a fungus of
rye-grain), and Read and Kobert have expended much ingenuity
in support of this hypothesis. One of the Athenian corn routes
did actually tap the northern shores of the Euxine, and southern
Russia has been one of the chief centres of epidemics of ergotism.
But there is no need to invoke this condition, to explain symptoms
which are commonly encountered in typhus, and no warrant
either for so doing, seeing that the clinical features of the visitation
had little in common with ergotism. Kobert’s ingenious arguments
in favour of ergotism, superimposed on some other
unidentified disease, merely substitute one <i>impasse</i> for another.</p>

<p>Thucydides observes that one feature distinguished the
Athenian pestilence from ordinary diseases. Birds and beasts of
prey, which feed on human flesh, would not as a rule touch the
bodies, but, if they did, they died. In fact, the birds of prey
disappeared altogether, and were not to be seen either about the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
bodies or anywhere else. In the case of the dogs this was particularly
noticeable, because they live with man. The paragraph
is curiously involved, but contains three statements of fact:</p>

<p>1. That vultures were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>2. That dogs avoided the dead bodies, as a rule, but that,
when they did not, they took the disease.</p>

<p>3. That other animals, which feed on carrion, and within the
walls of Athens these can hardly have been other than rats and
cats, and possibly pigs, were affected like the dogs.</p>

<p>There is no evidence as to the effect on cattle, horses, sheep,
and goats, because all these had been removed to Euboea.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of the disappearance of birds of prey before
and during outbreaks of epidemic pestilence has been asserted
again and again in literature. Yet it is very doubtful if the
observation rests on any sure evidence. Search has brought to
light only one occasion on which the truth of the fact has been
deliberately tested, and then it was directly contradicted.
Russell says that at the commencement of the plague of Aleppo,
in which true plague was ushered in by typhus, no desertion of
birds was observed, and no mortality among cattle. The old-time
fancy that pestilence engendered in the clouds distempered
the atmosphere almost necessarily involved the presumption
that the feathered inhabitants of the air would be the first to
feel its ill effects. In the same way the belief that pestilence
might reach the atmosphere in the exhalations from marshes,
led to similar fables attaching themselves to the marsh-dwelling
frog. Aristotle alludes to the increased number of frogs in
pestilential years, and Bacon and Horstius repeat his statement.
These children of the marsh are conceived of as products of its
undue activity. Horstius went so far as to assert the same of
snails.</p>

<p>Livy<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> clearly asserts the disappearance of vultures from Rome
before and during the epidemic of 174 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> ‘Cadavera, intacta
a canibus et vulturibus, tabes absumebat: satisque constabat,
nec illo, nec priore anno, in tanta strage boum hominumque
vulturium usquam visum.’ [Dead bodies rotted away, untouched
by dogs and vultures: and it was generally agreed that no
vultures were to be seen either in that or the preceding year in
spite of so great a mortality of men and cattle.] In this instance,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
then, it was not that they scented death from afar and held
aloof, but that they disappeared beforehand. If some undetected
epizootic—say of rats—had preceded the outbreak among cattle
and men, the vultures may well have perished at the outset from
feeding on infected material.</p>

<p>Other authors extend the observation to birds in general, and
not only to birds of prey, as though their affection was truly
epizootic. Thus Schenkius<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> says that in the plagues of 1505 and
1522 birds deserted their nests and young ones. Goclenius says
the same of the plague of 1612, and that they fell suddenly to
the ground dead. Mercurialis says that Venice was deserted by
birds in 1576, and Short repeats this of Dantzig in 1709. Diemerbroeck
says that cage-birds died in the epidemics of 1635 and
1636, and Sorbait records the same fact of the Viennese pestilence
of 1679. Most, if not all this succession of epidemics,
were unquestionably true Oriental plague, with or without
typhus.</p>

<p>At present there is very little evidence of any extensive affection
of the lower animals by typhus. Mosler, many years ago, failed
to communicate it to dogs by injecting fresh typhus blood into
their veins, or by feeding them on fresh typhus excreta, although
death with typhoid symptoms followed, when the blood and
stools had first been allowed to decompose. In the last few
years experimenters have succeeded in communicating the
disease to various monkeys by the agency of lice, but dogs, rats,
and guinea-pigs have hitherto proved refractory to infection.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is abundant evidence of animal
infection with Oriental plague. Epizootics among rats and cats
are well known. Boccaccio asserted the susceptibility of pigs,
and Michoud confirmed the observation in the Yunnan epidemic
of 1893. Dogs, poultry, deer, cattle, monkeys, squirrels, and
marmots have all been shown by various observers to be prone
to contagion.</p>

<p>Before accepting the evidence of Thucydides as to the disappearance
of birds as weighty evidence in favour of the presence
of true plague, one must consider the state of the country district
around Athens, devastated by fire and the sword, and denuded
of all its stock, so as to offer no promise of sustenance to bird
visitors. But even so, one is still confronted by his statement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
as to the domestic dogs, which are known to be susceptible to
plague and not known to be susceptible to typhus.</p>

<p>Thucydides says that no one was attacked a second time, or
if he were the result was not fatal. Immunity of this kind, comparatively
complete, is alike characteristic of typhus and plague:
the question is one that has provoked considerable controversy
right down to modern times. Both Curschmann and Murchison
are agreed as to the extreme rarity of relapses and reinfections
in typhus: curiously, Murchison himself had two typical severe
attacks.</p>

<p>In the case of plague, Alexander Massaria,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> from his experience
at Vicenza, came to the conclusion that one attack rendered
a man immune with very few exceptions, but that a second attack
might be mortal. Mercurialis and Van Helmont were in agreement
as to the rarity of second attacks. Diemerbroeck<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> recorded
two cases of reinfection in the same year of the plague at Nymwegen,
and several cases at an interval of a few years. During
the plague of Marseilles in 1720, various writers observed cases
of reinfection, and relapse was also said to be frequent. In the
plague of 1771 at Moscow, Samilowitz, prejudiced by his own
advocacy of inoculation, denied the existence of reinfection, and
suffered retribution for his dogmatism by three relapses in his
own person. In the same plague both Mertens and Orraeus
recorded cases of reinfection. In the plague of Aleppo, Russell
noted 28 cases of reinfection within three years among 4,400
victims of plague. Thus the idea of complete immunity, so
prevalent popularly both in Europe and the Levant, must be
accepted with some reservation.</p>

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
